Master metadata sheets for Visualizing English Print corpora

To interact with metadata and Ubiqu+Ity spreadsheets (sort, merge, download), visit the VEP [(Master Metadata tool)] (http://vep.cs.wisc.edu/masterSheet/showMaster.html).

Supported by an Andrew Mellon Foundation grant, the Visualizing English Print (VEP) project seeks to aid humanist scholarship by enabling the computational processing of hundreds of thousands of texts. VEP is a collaboration between literary scholars and computer scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of Strathclyde, and the Folger Shakespeare Library. The group designs digital tools and corpora that draw heavily on the work of the Text Creation Partnership, using TEI-encoded XML editions of printed early English books. 

Corpora indicated in the spreadsheets use source files from EEBO-TCP Phase 1, EEBO-TCP Phase 2, ECCO-TCP, and Evans-TCP corpora. ECCO-TCP, EEBO-TCP Phase 1, and Evans-TCP corpora are in the public domain. Currently, EEBO-TCP Phase 2 text transcriptions are protected under agreement with the University of Michigan Libraries. Information provided about EEBO-TCP Phase 2 texts is granted through the license agreement and available for scholarly analysis.
