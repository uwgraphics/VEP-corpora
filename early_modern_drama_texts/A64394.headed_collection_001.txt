ANDRIA TERENTII Anglo-Latina.

TERENCE'S ANDRIA ENGLISH AND LATIN.

1. A Comedy touching one Chrysis, a Woman of Andro, (which is an Island in
the Mediterranean Sea) made by Publius Terentius an African of Carthage.

2. Acted at the Megalesian Games (exhibited by the Romans in Honour of their
(...), or great Gods, but especially of the Goddess Cybele, which was called
the Mother of the Gods) which began (as Goreanus observes out of Tully) about
the beginning of September, and lasted nine days, or (as some others write) on
the fourth of April, and continued six days.

When M. Fulvius and M. Glabrio were Aediles, or Officers, whose charge being
to oversee the Temples and private Houses which belonged to the City of Rome,
and to make provision for Stage-plays; they bought this Comedy, and took Order
to have it publicly acted. They were called Curules, because they were chosen
out of the Senators, and permitted to ride in (sella curuli) a Chair of State.

3. The chief Players, or Actors of it, were

4. Flaccus the Son of Claudius was the Musician or Song-man, that set or
appointed the tunes to be played on Shaumes or Hoboyes, or the like Pipes,
which had an even number of holes in them; And first with them that made a base
sound, and were held on the right side of the mouth, when serious matters were
acted; and then with such as made a shriller noise, and were held on the left
side of the mouth, when jesling, and merry conceits were used.

5. And the Comedy is altogether a Greek one, translated out of that excellent
Poet Menander, and contains in it nothing of any Roman business, but what
was done at Athens; and therefore i^. was acted in Mantles or Cloaks after the
Greek fashion.

6. It was published when M. Marcellus, and Cajus Sulpitius were Consuls of
Rome.

Ante Christum natum CLXII.

PAmphilus defloureth Glycerie, who was falsely thought to be
The sister of a whore, that was an Andrian woman by birth;
And when she was great with child, he plighted his faith to her,
That she should be his wife: also his father Simo had affianced to him
(Philumena) the daughter of Chremes; and as soon as he found for certain, that
he was in love,
He makes as though there should be a marriage; being desirous to know,
What mind his son had towards it:
Pamphilus, through Davus's persuasion, is not against it.
But after Chremes saw that Glycerie had a young son,
flies off from the match, and renounceth his son in Law.
Within a while after he bestows this his daughter Glycerie (which was known
unlooked for)
Upon Pamphilus, and his other daughter for a wife upon Charinus.
SOrorem falso creditam meretriculae,
Genere Andriae, Glycerium vitiat Pamphilus.
Gravida{que} facta, dat fidem, uxorem sibi
Fore hanc: nam aliam pater ei desponderat

Simulat futuras nuptias; cupiens, suus
Quid haberet animi filius, cognoscere.
Davi suasu non, repugnat Pamphilus.
Sed ex Glycerio natum ut vidit puerulum
recusat nuptias, generum abdicat.
Mox filiam Glycerium, Insperato agnitam
Dat Pamphilo hanc, aliam Charino conjugem.
WHen first the Poet (Terence) gave his mind to write (Comedies)
He thought it was the only business he had to look after,
That what Comedies he made might please the people:
But he finds it to fall out far otherwise;

Not that he may tell one the Plot, but answer the railing terms
Of the cankered old Poet (Luscus Lavinius.)
Now I pray you consider what thing they account as a fault:
Menander made Andria and Perinthia:

They differ not very much in the matter, yet
Are they much unlike in the composition, and manner of speech;
He confesses he took out of Perinthia, and put into Andria,
Those things which were sitting (for his purpose) and used them as his own.

Saying, it is not fit that Comedies should be spoiled:
Truly by making themselves so wise, they discover their own ^olly;
Who when they blame him, they find fault also
With Naevius, Plautus, and Ennius, whom this our Poet follows as his
Authors:

Than the over-clouded diligence of those fellows.
Now henceforth I advise them to be quiet hereafter, and forbear
To give ill language, least they come to hear of their ill doings.
Keep silence, show your selves impartial, and consider the matter,
viz.
Whether what Comedies he shall make a new hereafter,
Be worthy to be beheld, or driven off the stage rather by them.
POeta quum primum animum ad scribendum appulit,
Id sibi negoti credidit solum dari,
Populo ut placerent, quas fecissit fabulas.
Verum aliter evenire multo intelligit;

Non qui argumentum narrer, sed qui malevoli
Veteris Poetae maledict is respondeat.
Nunc quam rem vitio dent, quaeso, animum advertite;
Menander fecit Andriam Perinthiam;

Non ita dissimili sunt argumento, sed tamen
Dissimili oratione sunt factae, ac stylo,
Quae convenere, in Andriam ex Pirinthia
Fatetur transtulisse; at{que} usum pro suis:

Contaminari non decere fabulas.
Faciunt nae intelligendo ut nihil intelligent:
Qui cum hunc accusant, Naevium, Plautum, Ennium
Accusant; quos hic noster authors habet:

Potius, quam istorum obscuram diligentiam.
Dehinc ut quiescant, porro monco, desinant
Maledicere, malefacta no noscant sua.
Favete, adeste aequo animo, rem cognoscite,

Posthac quas faciet de integro comaedias,
Spectandae, an exigendae sint vobis prius.
YOu (Sirs) take these things away in a doors; get you gone. Sosia,
Come hither: I will speak a word or two with you.

I know what you would say,
For sooth, that these things should be well looked unto.

Nay, something else.

What is it?
That my skill can do for you more then this?


But these which I always observed to be in you,
Faithfulness and secrecy.

I wait to know your pleasure:

You know what a fair and easy service you always had with me,
Ever since I bought you of a little boy:

Because you did serve me with a good will;
I have requited you with the best thing I had.

I am mindful of it.

I do not repent of what I have done.

I am glad,
If I have done, or do do any thing that likes you Simo; and

But this (speech of yours) troubles me, for this rehearsal of old things
Is as it were an upbraiding of one that is forgetful of a good turn:
But do you tell me in a word what it is you would have with me.

So I will do: But first and foremost, I tell you this concerning this matter,


Why do you pretend it then?

You shall hear all the matter from the beginning;
By that means you shall understand my sons course of life, and my intent,
And what I would have you do in this matter.
For after he came towards mans estate, Sosia,

How could one know or discern his disposition,
Whilst want of years, fear and a Master held him in?

It is true.

That which all young men for the most part use to do,
Giving their minds to one employment or other, either
To keep horses or dogs for hunting, or to (hear) Philosophers;
He minded none of these things extraordinarily more then others,
And yet he minded them all pretty well.
I was glad of it.

Not without cause, for I hold it to be
A thing very requisite in ones life, that he do nothing too much.


With whomsoever he kept company, to yield himself to them,
And to do as they did, being thwart to no body,
Nor at any time putting forth himself before them; so as one may easily
Get commendations without envy, and purchase friends.


Soothing gains friends, and true-dealing hatred.

In the mean time a certain Woman about three years ago,
Removed from Andri into this neighbour-hood,
Being driven to it by poverty, and the neglect of her kindred;


Alas, I am afraid lest this Andrian Woman should bring something that is
nought.

At the first she lived chastely, sparingly and hardly,
Seeking to get a livelihood by spinning and carding;
But after a lover came and offered her hire,

Men is prone to fall from labour and follow lust)
She took their offer, and afterwards began to make a gain of it,
They who then loved her, by chance, as it fell out,
Brought my son thither with them, to bear them company.

He hath his pay. I did watch their foot betimes in a morning,
As they came and went, I used to ask them; Doest thou hear, boy?
I pray thee tell me, who had Chrysis yesterday? For that
Was the name of that Andrian woman.

I understand you.

They said
Phaedrus, or Clinia, or Niceratus; fon these three then
Loved all at once, Oh, but what did Pamphilus? what? he paid
His club, he supped with them; I was glad of it. Likewise another day
I made enquiry: I found nothing at all did touch Pamphilus,
In good earnest I thought him to be a sufficiently tried,

For he that hath to strive with men of such like dispositions,
And yet for all that his mind is not moved in that matter;
One may conclude he is a man able to have the guiding of his life.
That both pleased me well, and besides all men with one consent

That had a Son endued with so towardly a nature.
What needs many words? Chremes being moved by this report,
Came to me of his own mind, that he might bestow
His only daughter on my son for a wife, with a huge great portion.


What hinders, that a real marriage is not made?

You shall hear;
Within a few days, almost in which these things were a doing,
This our neighbour Chrysis died.

O well done!
You have made me happy: I doubted some harm from Chrysis.

There then my son
Chrysis;
He took order as well as they for the funeral; being sad all the while;
Now and then he shed a tear with them. This also pleased me well.
I thought thus with my self; he for a little acquaintance sake,
Takes this woman's death so heavily to be art:

I thought all these to be the properties of a kind nature,
Avd a gentle disposition. Why do I hold you with many words?
I my self also for his sake go forth to the burial,
Suspecting no harm at all.

How now, what is the matter!

You shall know.

That were there, I chanced to espy one young Damsel
Of a feature.

That was good perhaps.

And Sosia, Of a countenance
So modest, and so comely, that more could not be (in a woman.)
Because then she seemed to me to take on more then the rest,

I went to the maids that waited on her,
And asked who she might be; they said she was Chrysis sister:
It presently struck me to the heart. Alas, this is it indeed;
Hence come all those tears, this is the pity that he takes.



The funeral in the mean time,
Goes on forward: we follow after, we come to the burial place;
She is put into the fire; they weep. In the mean while this Sister
Whom I spake of, came to the flame somewhat rashly,
With a deal of danger. Then Pamphilus being much affrighted,

He runs to her: he takes the woman about the middle in his arms.
Ah my Glycerie, quoth he, what do you do? why go you about to cast away your
self?
Then she, so as one might easily perceive their wonted love,
Threw her self back upon him weeping very heavily.

Si. I return thence being angry, and taking it ill;
Neither had I cause sufficient for to chide him; he might have said
What have I done? what punishment have I deserved, or wherein have I done
amiss?
I have hindered her that would have thrown her self into the fire,
I have saved her life, this is an honest excuse.

You think rightly:

What would you do to him that hath wrought one harm or mischief?

Chremes came to me the next day, crying out,
That he had found out a shameful act, that Pamphilus
Used this strange woman as if she were his wife. I stoutly

I so parted from him, as from one that denied to match his daughter
To my son.

Did not you chide your son then?

Neither was this indeed
A sufficient cause to chide him. So. Why so? tell me.

He might have said, Father, you your self have appointed an end for these
things,

Let me now in the mean time, live as I will my self.

What occasion then is there left to chide him?

If he will not marry a wife (which is promised) because of his love to
Glycerie,
He must first be punished for that fault,

I may have a just cause to chide him, if he quite deny it.
And withal that that roguish Davus, if he have any knavish device,
May vent it now whilst his tricks can do no harm:
Who I verily believe will do all he can with tooth and nail,

Then to follow my sons humour.

Why so?

Do you ask?
An evil mind, an evil meaning; whom truly, if I find him
But need is there of words? But if it fall out as I desire,
That there be no stop in Pamphilus; Chremes remain's

Now it is your part, that you handsomely fain this marriage,
That you fright Davus to purpose, and be sure to watch my son,
What he doth, and what advice he takes with him.

It is enough,
I will have a care of it; let us go in now.

Go before, I will come after.

VOs isthaec intro auferte: abite. Sosia,
Adesdum: paucis te volo.

Dictum puta.
Nempe ut curentur recte haec.

Imo aliud.

Quid est
Quod tibi mea ars efficere hoc possit amplius?


Sed his quas semper in te intellexi sitas,
Fide taciturnitate.

Expecto quid velis.

Ego postquam te emi a parvulo, ut semper tibi
Apud me justa clemens fuerit servitus,

Propterea quod serviebas liberaliter.
Quod habui summum pretium, persolvi tibi.

In memoria habeo.

Haud muto factum.

Gaudeo,
Si tibi quid feci, aut facio, quod placeat, Simo,

Sed mi hoc molestum est: nam isthaec commemoratio
Quasi exprobratio est immemoris benefici.
Quin tu uno verbo dic, quid est quod me velis.

Ita faciam. Hoc primum in haecre praedico tibi,


Cur simulas igitur?

Rem omnem a la audies.
Eo pacto gnati vitam, consilium meum
Cognosces, quid facere in hac re te velim.
Nam is postquam excessit ex ephaebis, Sosia,

Qui scire posses aut ingenium noscere,
Dum aetas, metus, magister prohibebant?

Ita est.

Quod plerique omnes faciunt adolescentuli,
Ut animum ad aliquod studium adjungant, aut equos
Alere, aut canes ad venandum, aut ad Philosophes;
Horum ille nihil egregie praeter caetera
Studebat, tamen omnia haec mediocriter.
Gaudebam.

Non injuria: nam id arbitror
Adprime in vita esse utile, ut no quid nimis.


Cum quibus erat cun{que} una, iis sese dedere,
Eorum obsequi studiis, adversus nemini,
Nunquam praeponens se illis; ita facillime
Sine invidia laudem invenias, amicos pares.


Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit.

Interea mulier quaedam abhinc triennium
Ex Andro commigravit huic viciniae,
Inopia cognatorum negligent a


Hei, vereor, no quid Andria apporter mali.

Primum haec pudice vitam, parce, ac duriter
Agebat, lana ac tela victum quaeritans:
Sed postquam amans accessit, pretium pollicens,

Hominum a labore proclive ad libidinem)
Accepit conditionem, dein quaestum occipit.
Qui tum illam amabant, forte, ita ut fit, filium
Perduxere illuc secum, ut una esset, meum:

Habet. Observabam mane illorum servulos
Venientes aut abeuntes, rog^t^bam; Heus puer,
Dic sodes, quis heri Chrysidem habuit? nam Andriae
Illi id erat nomen.

Tenco.

Phaedrum, aut Cliniam

Amabant. Eho, quid Pamphilus? quid? symbolam
Dedit, caenavit: gaudebam. Item alio die
Quaerebam; comperiebam nihil ad Pamphilum
Quicquam attingere. Enimve. o spectatum satis

Nam qui cum ingeniis conflictatur ejusmodi,
No{que} comm^etur animus in ea re tamen;
Scias posse habere jam ipsum suae vitae modum.
Cum id mihi placebat, tum uno ore omnes omnia

Qui gnatum haberem tali ingenio praeditum.
Quid verbis opus est? hac fama impulsus Chremes
Ultro ad me venit, unicam gnatam suam
Cum dote summa filio uxorem ut daret.


Quid obstat, cur non verae fiant?

Audies.
Fere in diebus paucis, quibus haec acta sunt,
Chrysis vicina haec moritur.

O factum been!
Beasti; metui a Chryside.

Ibi tum filius meus
Chrysidem, una aderat frequens;
Curabat una funus, trist is interim;
Nonnunquam conlachrymabat. Placuit tum id mihi.
Sic cogitabam: hic parvae consuetudinis
Causa, mortem hujus tam fert familiariter:

Haec ego putabam esse omnia humani ingenii
Mansueti{que} animi officia. Quid multis moror?
Egomet quo{que} ejus causa in funus predeo,
Nihil suspicans etiam mali:

Hem, quid est?

Skies.

Quae ibi aderant, forte unam adspicio adolescentulam,
Forma.

Bona fortasse.

Et vultu, Sosia,
Adeo modesto, adeo venusto, ut nihil supra.
Quia tum mihi lamentari praeter caeteras

Honesta ac liberali, accedo ad paedissequas,
Quae sit rogo; sororem esse aiunt Chrysidis.
Percussit illico animum. Atat, hoc illud est:
Hinc illae lachrymae; haec illa est misericordia.



Funus interim
Procedit: sequimur: ad sepnlchrum venimus:
In ignem posita est: Fletur. Interea haec soror,
Quam dixi, ad flammam accessit imprudentius
Satis cum periculo. Ibi tum exanimatus Pamphilus

Adcurrit: mediam mulierem complectitur.
Mea Glycerium, inquit, quid agis? cur te is perditum?
Tum illa, ut consuetum facile morem cerneres,
Rejecit se in eum flens quam familiariter.



Redeo inde iratus, at{que} aegre ferens:
Nec satis ad objurgandum causae; diceret,
Quid feci? quid commerui aut peccavi, pater?
Quae sese voluit in ignem injicere, prohibui,
Servavi, Honesta oration est.

Recte putas:

Quid facias illi, qui dederit damnum, aut malum?

Venit Chremes postrid^e ad me, clamitans,
Indignum facinus comperisse; Pamphilum
Pro uxore habere hanc peregrinam. Ego illud sedulo

Ita tum discedo ab illo, ut qui se filiam
Negat daturum.

Non tu ibi gnatum?

No haec quidem
Satis vehemens causa ad objurgandum.

Qui, cedo?
Si tute ipse his rebus finem praescripsti, pater.

Sine nunc me meo vivere interea modo.

Quis igitur relictus est objurgandi locus?

Si propter amorem uxorem nolit ducere,
Ea primum ab illo animadvertenda injuria est.

Vera objurgandi causa sit, si deneget.
Simul, sceleratus Davus si quid consilii
Habet, ut consumat nunc, cum nihil obsint doli:
Quem ego credo manibus pedibus{que} obnixe omnia

Quam ut obsequatur gnato.

Quapropter?

Rogas?
Mala men's, malus animus. Quem quidem ego si sensero --
Sed quid opus est verbis? sin eveniat quod volo,
In Pamphilo ut nihil sit morae; restat Chremes,

Nunc tuum est officium, has been ut adsimules nuptias;
Perterrefacias Davum, observes filium,
Quid agate, quid cum illo consilii capte^.

Sat est,
Curabo, eamus jam nunc intro.

I prae, sequar.

THere is no doubt, but my son will have no wife:
I perceived Davus erewhile to fear so, as soon as he heard
That there was likely to be a marriage; but he hmself comes forth a doors.

I wondered, if this matter should go thus, and I feared

That a wife would not be given to his son, did never
Speak a word to any one of us, nor did he take it impatiently.

But now he will, and as I suppose, to thy great cost.

This was it that he aimed at, that we should be brought unawares into a fools
Paradise;

So as we might have no time to think how to hiuder the marriage:
It is cunningly done.

What saith the Rogue?

Here is my master, and I was not aware of him.

Davus!

How now, what is the matter?

Come hither to me.

What would this fellow have?

What say you?

About what?

Doest thou ask? It is reported that my Son is in love.



Doest thou mind what I say, or no.

Truly I mind it.

But, for me now to sift out these things,
It is the property of a harsh Father; for what he did heretofore, belongs
not at all to me.
Whilst time permitted that matter, I let him take his swinge.
Now it is time for him to take another course, and to change his manners;
Davus, that he may now become a new man.

What should this mean?

All that are in love take it ill that a wife should be appointed them.

So they say.

Then If one have got a l^wd Tutor for that matter,
He commonly turns his crazy mind the wrong way.

Truly I do not understand you.

No! How now?

No, I am plain Davus, not Oedipus, the expounder of Riddles.



Yes indeed.

If I perceive thee go about any knavery to day concerning the marriage, that
it may not be:
Or that thou hast a mind to show in the matter, how crafty thou art;
I will commit thee Davus into the house of Correction to be whipped to death,
On this condition and aboding, that if I take thee out thence, I will grind for
thee.


Yes, very well:
Now you have spoke the thing plainly, you have not gone about the bush.

I can more willingly abide to be abused in any thing then in this.

Good words I pray you.

Doest thou mock me? I know thee well enough: But I tell thee,
That thou do it not too rashly, and that thou may not say, but that ^air
warning was given thee.

NOn dubium est, quin uxorem nolit filius:
Ita Davum modo timere sensi, ubi nuptias
Futuras esse audivit; sed ipse exit for as.

Mirabar, hoc si sic abiret; heri semper lenitas,

Non datum iri filio uxorem suo, nunquam cuiquam
Nostrum verbum fecit, neque id aegre tulit.

At nunc faciet, neque ut opinor, sine tuo magno malo.

Id voluit, nos sic nec opinantes duci falso gaudio,

Ut no esset spatium cogitandi ad disturbandas nuptias.
Astute!

Carnifex quae loquitur?

Herus est, no{que} praevideram,

Dave!

Hem, quid est?

Ehodum ad me.

Qui^ hic volt?

Quid ais?

Qua de re?

Rogas? Meum gnatum rumour est


Id populus curat scilicet.

Hoccine agis
Annon?

Ego vero istuc.

Sed nunc ea me exquirere,
Iniqui patris est; nam, quod antehac fecit, nihil ad me attinet.
Dum tempus ad ^am rem tulit, sivi animum ut expleret suum,
Nunc hic dies aliam vitam adfert, alios mores postulat.


Hoc quid sit?

Omnes qui amant, graviter sibi uxorem dari ferunt.

Ita a junt.

Tum si quis magistrum cepit ad eam rem improbum, ^psum animum aegrotum ad
deteriorem partem plerun{que} applicat.

Non hercle intelligo.

Non? hem.

Non: Davus sum, non O^dipus.



Sane quidem.
Si sensero body quicquam in his te nuptiis fallacia conari quo fiant minus:
^ut velle in re ostendi quam sis callidus,
^erberibus caesum te in pistrinum Dave, dedam, usque ad necem,
^a leg atque omine, ut si te inde exemerim, ego pro te molam.
(...). Quid? hoc intellextin? an nondum etiam no hoc quidem?

Imo callide.
(...) aperte ipsam rem modo locutus, nihil circuitione usus es.
Ubivis, facilius passus sam, quam in hac re, me deludier.
Bona verba, quaeso.

Irrides? nihil me fallis. Sed dico tibi,
(...) temere facias, neque tu haud dicas, tibi non praedictum cave.

IN good troth, Davus, it's no time (for thee) to be sloathfull sluggish;
As far as I apprehended of late the old mans intent about the marriage,
Which if it be not cunningly prevented, it will overthrow me or my Master:
Nor am I resolved certainly what to do; whether I should help Pamphilus, or
give ear to the old man:
Pamphilus, I am afraid of his life; but if I help him; I fear the old mans
threats about the marriage,
Whom it is a hard matter to beguile: For first he hath already found the truth
about this love matter,
And he watches me with a deadly-eye, lest I should play any knavery:
If he catch me, I am undone; or if he list, he will take an occasion:
So be it right or wrong, he will send me headlong into the house of
correction.
Andrian woman,
Whether she be his wife, or his sweet-heart, is with child by Pamphilus.
And it is worth the labour to hear their bold presumption: For they begin
themselves
Like madfolks, not like lovers: Whatever God shonld send her, they resolved to
bring it up.
And they feign a apiece of knavery now amongst them,
(Glycerie) is a Citizen of Athens. There was (s^ they) a good while ago an old
man
A merchant; he suff^red shipwreck at the Isle Andr^:
He deceased: there then Chrysis Father harboured
This girl being cast ashore, being succourless, and small. These ar^ but
tales,
I do not think it likely to be true, and yet the conceit pleases them.
Mysis comes sorth from her, now I will go hence to th^ market, that
I may speak with Pamphilus, lest his father come upon him at un^ wares about
this matter.

ENimvero, Dave, nihil loci est segnitiae, neque socordiae,
Quantum intellexi modo senis sententiam de nuptiis:
Quae si non ast ^providentur, me aut herum pess^ndabunt.
Nec quid agam, certum est: Pamphilumne adjutem, an auscultem seni.

Cui verba dare difficile est. Primum jam de amore hoc comperit;
Me infensus servat, no quam faciam in nuptiis fallaciam.
Si senserit, perii; aut si libitum fuerit, causam ceperit,
Quo jure, quaque injuria, praecipitem me in pistrinum dabit.

Sive ista uxor, sive amica est; gravida a Pamphilo est,
Audireque corum est operae pretium audaciam. Nam incaeptio est
Amentium, haud amantium. Quicquid peperisset, decreverunt tollere.
Et fingunt quandam inter se nunc fallaciam,

Mercator: navem is fregit apud Andrum insulam:
Is obiit mortem: ibi tum hanc ejectam Chrysidis
Patrem recepisse orbam, parvam. Fabulae.
Mihi quidem hercle non fit verisimile, atqui ipsis commetum placet.

Conveniam Pamphilum, no de hac re pater imprudentem opprimat.

ARchillis, I heard you erewhile, you bid Lesbia should be fetched;
In very deed, she is a drunken woman, and rash-handed,
And scare fit with whom one should adventure a woman of her first child.
Yet I will go setch her; I pray you, mind the importuna^ness of the old trot,

A safe deliverance, and her to miss in her office rather towards others.
But what's the matter I see Pamphilus so dismayed? I fear what it should be
for.
I will tarry to know what heavy news this trouble of mind brings us.

AUdivi, Archillis, jamdudum: Lesbiam adduci jubes:
Sane pol illa temuienta est mulier, temeraria,
Nec satis digna, eui committas primo partu mulierem,
Tamen eam adducam. Importunitatem spectate aniculae;

Huic pariundi, at{que} illi in aliis potius peccandi locum.
Sed quidnam Pamphilum exanimatum video? vereor, quid si^t.
Opperiar, ut sciam, number quidnam haec turba tristitiae adferat.

IS this a friendly deed, or undertaking? Is this
The part of a father?

What is that he saith?

O the faith of gods and men!
What is, if this be not, a mere spite? He was resolved
To bestow a wife on me to day. Was it not meet I should have know^ of it
before? was it not meet


Ah me poor woman, what words do I hear?

What means Chremes? who had denied to give his daughter to wife,
He hath altered that resolution, because he sees me so constant;
Is he so crossly bent to part me poor man from Glycerie,
Which if it come to pass, I am flat undone: That any man

O the faith of God and man! Can I by no means avoid
The alliance of Chremes? How many ways am I scorned and slighted;
All things were done and dispatched: Lo, I that was cast off am again sent
for.
Why so? except it be as I suspect; they cloak some secret fault.


This saying
Hath abashed me poor woman with fear.

For what should I say of my father? Alas,
That he should do such a great matter so carelessly! as he passed by me
erewhile
At the market, he said, Pamphilus, you must be married to day, get you ready;
Go your way home; me thought he said, Go quickly and hang thy self;

Or to make any excuse, were it never so absurd, false, or unjust? I was dumb:
But had I wist that before, if one should ask me what I would have done?
I would have done somewhat, so as I might not do this. But now what shall I do
first?
So many cares entangle me, which hale my mind too and fro.

Besides the shame of my father, who hath so gently suffered me hitherto,
To do whatsoever pleased my own humour: Should I cross him,
Wo is me! I am uncertain what to do.

I silly woman do fear,
What this uncertain thing may come to: But now it is requisite either that he
speak with her;

It is moved this way or that way with a small weight.

Who is this that talks here?
Mysis, God save you.

God save you Pamphilus.

How doth she?

Do you ask?
She is in hard labour, and the poor woman is troubled about this, this
Because the marriage was appointed a good while since against day, and besides
she is afraid of this,


What? Can I find in my heart to do that?
Should I suffer her poor woman to be deceived through me,
Who committed her mind and all her life to me;
Whom I most entirely loved, as if she had been my wife,
Shall I suffer her good nature that was well and orderly brought up,

I will not do it.

I do not fear it, if it were in your power only.
But I fear you cannot be able to abide the blunt.

Do you think me so base-minded,
And withal so ungrateful, or unmanly, or like a beast,
That neither acquaintance, nor love, nor shame


This one thing I know, that she hath deserved, that you should be mindful of
her.

That I should be mindful! O Mysis, Mysis, those words of Chrysis
Concerning Glycerie are even at this time printed in my mind;
When she was just ready to give up the ghost, she called me,

O my Pamphilus, you see this woman's beauty and age,
Neither are you to be told, how inconvenient both things are to her,
Both to preserve her honesty, and her estate.
And therefore I entreat you by this right hand of yours, and your good nature,

That you would not part her from you, nor for sake her:
If I have loved you, as if you had been mine own brother,
Or she hath valued you alone above all men in the world,
Or was in all things ready to observe your commands:

I commit these our goods to you, and deliver them to your trust.
She delivered her to me into my hand: death presently seized upon her.
I took her, I will keep her now I have taken her.

I hope no less.

But why do you go away from her?

I am going for the Midwife.


About the marriage; lest this also should increase her grief.

I understand you.

HOccine est humanum factum, aut incoeptum? hoccine est
Officium patris?

Quid illud est?

Pro Deum fidem atque hominum,
Quid est, si haec non contumelia est? Uxorem decreverat
Dare sese mihi body. Nonne oportuit praescisse me ante? nonne prius,


Miseram me! quod verbum audio?

Quid Chremes? qui denegarat se commissurum mihi
Gnatam suam uxorem, id mutavit, la me immutatum vide:
Itane obstinatc operam dat, ut me a Glycerio miserum
Abstrahat. Quid si fit, pereo funditus. Adeon' hominem

Pro Deum at{que} hominum fidem! nullone ego Chremetis pacto
Affinitatem effugere poteto? Quot modis contemptus, spretus?
Facta transacta omnia. Hem! repudiatus repetor.
Quamobrem? nisi id est quod suspicor; Aliquid monstri alunt.


Oration haec
Me miseram exanimavit metu.

Nam quid ego dicam de patre? at
Tantamne rem tam negligenter agere (...) praeteriens modo mihi
Apud forum, Uxor tibi ducenda est Pamphile body, inquit, para,
Abi domum. Id mihi visus est dicere, Abi cito, suspend te.

Aut ullam causam, ineptam saltem, falsam, iniquam? obmutui.
Quod si ego tescissem id prius, quid facerem, si quis nunc me roger,
Aliquid facerem, ut hoc no facerem. Sed nunc quid primum exequar?
Tot me impediunt curae, quae meum animum diverse trahunt.

Tum patris pudor, qui me tam leni passus est animo usque adhuc
Quae meo cunque libitum est animo facere; eine ego ut adverser,
Hei mihi! incertum est quid agam.

Misera timeo, incertum hoc
Quorsum accidat. Sed nunc peropus est, aut hunc cum ipsa, aut aliquid

Paulo momento huc vel illuc impellitur.

Quis hic loquitur?
Mysis, salve.

O salve, Pamphile.

Quid agit?

Rogas?
Laborat e dolor, atque ex hoc misera, sollicita est, diem
Quia olim in hunc constitutae nuptiae; tum autem hoc timet,


Hem! egone istuc conari queam!
Egon' propter me illam decipi miseram sinam?
Quae mihi suum animum atque omnem vitam credidit;
Quam ego animo egregie charam pro uxore habuerim,
Been pudice ejus doctum atque eductum, sinam

Non faciam.

Haud vereor, si in te solo sit situm;
Sed vim ut queas far.

Adeon' me ignavum putas,
Adeon' porro ingratum, aut inhumanum, aut ferum,
Ut no{que} consuetudo, neque amor, neque pudor


Unum hoc scio, hanc meritam esse, ut memor esses sui.

Memor essem! O Mysis, Mysis, etiam nunc mihi
Scripta illa dicta sunt in animo Chrysidis,
De Glycerio. Jam ferme moriens, me la:

Mi Pamphile, hujus formam atque aetatem vides;
Nec clam te est, quam illi nunc utrae{que} res inutiles
Et ad pudicitiam ad rem tutandam sient.
Quod ego te per hanc dextram oro, ingenium tuum,

Te obtestor, no abs te hanc segreges, neu descras;
Si te in germani fratris dilexi loco,
Sive haec te solum semper fecit maximi,
Seu tibi morigera fuit in rebus omnibus:

Bona nostra haec tibi committo, tuae mando fidei.
Hanc mihi in manum dat: mors continuo ipsam occupat.
Accepi, acceptam servabo.

Ita spero quidem.

Sed cur tu abis ab illa?

Obstetricem accerso.


De nuptiis; no ad morbum hoc etiam.

Teneo.

what say you Byrrhia? Is she to be married to Pamphilus to day?

Yes.

How know you Byrrhia?

I heard it of Daus now at the market.

Wo is me poor man.
As my mind bath been always held heretofore betwixt hope and fear, So, since
hope is taken away, being wenry and spent with care, it is dismayed.

I pray your heartily Charinus, seeing that cannot be done which you desire,
That you would desire what may be done.

I would have nothing but Philumena.

Alas, how much better were it for you to strive to remove this love
Out of your mind, than to utter that whereby your desire is kindled
More in vain.

We can all lightly when we are well,
Give good advice to such as are sick. If you were in my case, you would think
otherwise.

Go to, go to:
Do as you list.

But I see Pamphilus. I am resolved to try all means rather than perish.

What doth he do?

I will entreat him, I will beseech him, I will
Discover my love to him, I think I shall prevail that he would put off the
marriage at least a few days.
In the mean time, I hope something will be done.

That something is nothing.

Byrrhia,
What do you think of it? Had I best go to him?

What else? if that you may get nothing,
Yet that he may think you are ready to cuckoldize him, if he marry her.

Get you hence, you rogue, with a mischief, with that ill thought of thine.

I see Charinus. God save you.

O, God save you Pamphilus.
I come to you requesting hope, safety, help and advice.

Truly I am not able to give you counsel, neither can I help you.
But what is that you desire?

Are you to be married to day?

So they say.

Pamphilus, if you do so, you shall never see my face after to day.

Why so?

Wo is me, I am loath to tell you; I pray thee Byrrhia, tell him:

I will tell you.

What is it?

He is in love with your Bride.

Truly he is not of
My mind. Come hither and tell me Charinus, had you any thing more to do with
her.

Alas, Pamphilus, nothing.

I wish you had.

Now
I entreat your for our friendship and loves sake, first and foremost, that you
would not marry her.

Truly I will do my endeavour.

But if you cannot avoid it, or that
This marriage be according to your heart.

My heart?

Put it off at least for a few days, whilst I go
Somewhither, that I may not see it.

Do but hear now; Charinus, I in no wise hold it
To be the part of an honest man, to desire thanks to be given him
When he deserves none. I am more more desirous to be rid of this marriage,
then you are to obtain it.

You have revived my spirit.

Now if you can do any thing your self, or this Byrrhia,
Do it, faign it, find it out, bring it abe ut, how she may be given you.
I will handle the matter, as she may not be given to me.

I have enough.

I sec Davus in very good time,
Whose advice I rely upon.

But you forsooth can tell me nothing,
Except such things as are not worth the knowing. Can you be gone?

I will be gone truly, and with all my heart.

QUid ais, Byrrhia? Daturne illa Pamphilo body nuptum?

Sic est.

Qui scis, Byrrhia?

Apud forum modo de Davo audivi.

Vae misero mihi.
Ut animus in spe atque in timore usque antehac attentus fuit,
Ita, postquam adempta spes est, lassus, cura confectus stupet.


Id velis quod possit.

Nihil volo aliud nifi Philumenam.

Ah, quanto satius est, te id dare operam, qui istum amorem
Ex animo amoveas tuo, quam id loqui, quo magis libido
Frustra incendatur tua.

Facile omnes cum valemus, recta


Age, age,
Ut lubet.

Sed Pamphilum video. Omnia experiri certum est, prius, quam pereo.

Quid hic agit?

Ipsum hunc orabo, huic supplicabo, amorem
Huic narrabo meum. Credo impetrabo, ut aliquot saltem nuptiis protrahat dies.
Interea fiet aliquid, spero.

Id aliquid nihil est.

Byrrhia,


Quid ni? si nihil ut impetres,
Ut te arbitretur sibi paratum maechum, si illam duxerit.

Abi hinc in malam rem cum suspitione isthac, scelus.

Charinum video. Salve.

O salve, Pamphile.
Ad te venio, spem, salutem, auxilium, consilium expetens.


Sed istuc quidnam est?

Body uxorem ducis?

Ita aiunt.

Pamphile, si id facis, body postremum me vides.

Quid ita?

Hei mihi, vereor dicere; huic dic quaeso, Byrrhia.

Ego dicam.

Quid est?

Sponsam hic tuam amat.

Nae iste haud mecum

Charine?

Aha, Pamphile, nihil.

Quam vellem.

Nunc
Te per amicitiam, per amorem obsecro, la, ut no ducas.

Dabo equidem operam.

Sed si id non potes, aut tibi nuptiae
Have sunt cordi.

Cordi?

Saltem aliquot dies profer, dum proficiscor


Audi nunc jam: Ego, Charine, neutiquam officium
Liberi esse hominis puto, cum is nihil promereat, postulare id gratiae
Apponi fibi: nuptias effugere ego istas malo, quam tu adipiscier.

Reddidisti animum.

Nunc si quid potes aut tu, aut hic Byrrhia,
Facite, fingite, invenite, efficite, qui detur tibi:


Sat habeo.

Davum optime
Video, cujus consilio fretus sum.

At tu hercle haud quicquam mihi,
Nisi ea quae nihil opus sunt scire. Fugin' hinc?

Ego vero ac lubens.

GOod God! what good news do I bring? but where shall I find Pamphilus,
That I may now rid him of the fear he is in, and fill his heart with joy?

He is merry, I know not for what.

There is no cause, he hath not yet understood these mischiefs.

Whom I verily believe, if he hath already heard that a match is provided for
him.

Do you hear him, or no?

That like a man distracted, he is seeking me all the town over:
But where shall I seek him? whither shall I now go first?

Do you forhear to speak to him.

I am gone.

Davus, come hither; tarry.

What man is that, that calls me? O Pamphilus,
You are the man I look for. O brave, O Charinus, both in good time! you are
the men I desire to speak withal.

Davus, I am undone.

But hear me this.

I am quite undone.

Truly my life is in danger.

And I know too what you fear.

A marriage is provided me.

Although I know it.

To day.

You weary me with your words, though I understand it,
You fear this, lest you should marry Philumena; and you, left you should not
marry her.

You hit the nail on the head.

That same is it.

But that same, it hath no danger in it, I warrant you.

I pray you rid me poor man out of this fear as so on as may be.

Look you,
I do rid you: Chremes will not now bestow a wise on you.

How know you?

I know.
Your Father caught hold of me erewhile; he said he would help you to a wife
To day, And many other things, whi^h it is now no time to talk of.
I presently hasted, and ran quite to the market place, to tell you these
things:
When I could not find you, I got up there into an high place;
I look round about; you were nowhere to be seen. By chance I espied this mans
servant Byrrhia:
I asked him for you; he said he did not see you: This troubled me: I bethink
me what to do.
In the mean time, as I came back, I began to mistrust from the very matter;
ho,
A small provision; he himself is sad: a marriage all on a sudden!
These things do not hang together.

What of all this?

I presently went to Chremes house.
When I came thither, there was no body about the door, I was now glad of that.


You say well.

Go on.

I tarry there; in the mean time I see no body
Go in, I see no body come forth; I see no elderly woman, in the house
There was no decking it up; no rushing at all: I went nearer, and peeped in.

I know
This is a great sign.

Do these things seem to agree with a marriage?
I think no, Davus.

Do you say, I think? You mistake the matter:
It is sure enough. Moreover as I was coming thence, I met Chreme's boy,
Carrying pot-herbs, and a half penny-worth of small fish for the oldmans
supper.

Davus, I am acquitted by your means to day.

But never a jot.

Why so? Surely Chremes will not give her at all to him.

You Cox-comb:
As though it must needs follow, if he give her not to him, that you must marry
her.
Unless you look about you, unless you entreat the old mans friends, you go
about the bush.

You advise me well;
I will go, though indeed this hope hath already failed me often; farewell.

DIi boni! boni quid porto? Sed ubi inveniam Pamphilum?
Ut metum in quo est nure, adimam, atque expleam animum gaudio?

Laetus est, nescio quid.

Nihil est, nondum haec rescivit mala.

Quem ego nunc credo si jam audierit sibi paratas nuptias.



Toto me oppido exanimatum quaerere.
Sed ubi quaeram? quo nunc primum intendam?

Ceffas loqui?

Abeo.

Dave, ades, resist.

Quis homo est qui me? O Pamphile,
Teipsum quaero. Euge, o Charine, ambo opportune. Vos volo.

Dave, perii.

Quin tu hoc audi.

Interii. D. Quid timeas scio.



Et quid tu, scio.

Nuptiae mihi.

Etsi scio.

Body.

Obtundis, tametsi intelligo.
Id paves, no ducas tu illam: tu autem, ut ducas.

Rem tenes.

Isthuc ipsum.

Atqui istuc ipsum nihil pericli est, me vide.

Obsecro te, quamprimum hoc me libera miserum metu.

Hem,


Qui scis?

Scio.
Tuus pater modo me apprehendit; ait tibi uxorem dare sese
Body. Item alia multa, quae nunc non est narrandi locus.
Continuo at te properans, procurro ad forum, ut dicam tibi haec.
Ubi te non invenio, ibi ascendo in quendam excelsum locum,

Rogo: negat vidisse. Mihi molestum; quid agam, cogito.
Redeunti interea ex ipsa re mihi incidit suspicion, hem,
Paululum obsonii: ipsus tristis: de improviso nuptiae:
Non cohaerent.

Quorsum nam istuc:

Ego me continuo ad Chremem.


Recte dicis.

Perge.

Maneo: interea introire neminem
Video, exire neminem; matronam nullam, in aedibus
Nihil ornati; nihil tumulti: accessi, introspexi.

Scio,
Magnum signum.

Number videntur convenire haec nuptiis?



Opinor, narras? non recte accipis:
Certa res est. Etiam puerum inde abiens conveni Chremis;
Olera pisculos minutos ferr^obolo in coenam senis.

Liberatus sum, Dave, body tua opera.

At nullus quidem.

Quid ita? nempe huic prorsus illam non dat.

Ridiculum caput;

Nisi vides, nisi senis amicos oras, ambis.

Been moans.
Ibo, etsi hercle saepe jam me spes haec frustrata est. Vale.

WHat means my Father then? Why doth he dissemble?

I will tell you:
If he now be angry, because Chremes doth not give you his daughter,
He may seem to himself to have done you wrong, and not without cause,
Before he understand how your mind is inclined towards marriage;
But if you deny to marry her, he will then lay all the blame upon you,
And then there will be an hurle-burle.

What? would you have me to endure it?

He is your Father, Pamphilus,
It is a hard case. Besides, she is an only woman; he will quickly find
Some occasion, why he may pack her out of the town.

Pack her out?

Out of hand.

Tell me then Davus, what should I do?

Say you will marry.

Ha.

What is the matter?

Shall I say so?

Why not?

I will never do it.

Do not say nay.

Do not offer to persuade me.

Consider what will become of it.

That I be
Shut out from Glycerie, and pent up with this woman.

It is not so. Verily,
I suppose your Father will thus say to you; I would have you marry a wise to
day:
You shall say, I will marry. Tell me what shall he chide with you for? By this
means you shall make all
His devices which be hath now certainly resolved (...), to become uncertain,
Without any danger at all. For this is out of question, that Chremes
Will not give you his daughter; nor should you for this reason forbear
These things which you do, for fear he should alter his mind.
Tell your father you are willing, that when he would rightly be angry with
you, he may not be able.

Bestow a wife upon a man of these conditions. He will find a mean match for
you (say I) rather then suffer you to be spoiled;
But if he perceive you take it contentedly, you may make him careless:
He will seek another for you at his leisure; in the mean time some good may
happen.

Do you think so?

There is no doubt of it.

Have a care,


But do you not say what you will do?

I will tell him, but a care must be taken,
That he may know I have a child by her, for I have promised,
That I would take it and bring it up.

O bold prank!

She entreated me
To make her this promise, that she might know I would nor forsake her.

A care shall be taken; but your father is here. Beware he see you not sad.

QUid igitur sibi vult pater? cur simulat?

Ego dicam tibi,
Si id succenseat nunc, quia non det tibi uxorem Chremes,
Ipsus sibi videatur esse injurius, no{que} id injuria,
Prius quam tuum animum ut sese habeat ad nuptias perspexerit.

Tum illae turbae fient.

Quid vis, patiar?

Pater est, Pamphile;
Difficile est; tum haec sola est mulier; dictum ac factum invenerit
Aliquam causam, quamobrem ejiciat oppido.

Ejiciat?

Cito.

Cedo igitur quid faciam, Dave?

Dic te ducturum.

Hem!

Quid est?



Cur non?

Nunquam faciam.

No nega.

Suadere noli.

Ex ea re quid fiat, vide.

Ut ab illa
Excludar, hac concludar.

Non ita est; nempe hoc
Sic esse opinor dicturum patrem: Ducas volo body uxorem.
Tu, ducam, inquies. Cedo quid jurgabit tecum? hic redde^ omnia

Sine omni periculo. Nam hoc haud dubium est, quin Chremes
Tibi non det gnatam: nec tu ea causa minueris
Haec quae facis, no is suam mutet sententiam.
Patri dic velle te; ut cum velit tibi jure irasci, non quear.

Dabit nemo. Inveniet inopem, potius quam te corrumpi sinat.
Sed si te aequo animo far accipiat, negligentem feceris;
Aliam otiosus quaeret; interea aliquid acciderit boni.

Itane credis?

Haud dubium id quidem est.

Vide,


Quin taces?

Dicam, puerum autem
No resciscat mihi esse ex illa, cautio est; nam pollicitus sum
Susceprurum.

O facinus audax.

Hanc fidem sibi
Me obsecravit, qui se sciret non deserturum, ut darem.

Curabitur; sed pater adest. Cave no te tristem esse sentiat.

I Come again to see what they do, or what they are consulting.

He now makes no doubt, but that you will refuse to marry.
He hath been studying somewhere by himself, and is come out of a bycorner;
He hops he hath got something to say, whereby he may baffle you;


I will do as well as I can, Davus.

Pamphilus, believe me, I say, in this; that your father
Will not exchange one word with you to day
If you will but say you will marry.

REviso quid agant, aut quid captent consilii.

Hic nunc non dubitat, quin te ducturum neges;
Venit meditatus alicunde ex solo loco:
Orationem sperat invenisse, qua differat te;


Modo ut possim, Dave.

Cred inquam hoc mihi, Pamphile; nunquam body
Tecum commutaturum patrem
Unum esse verbum, si te dices d^cere.

MY master commanded me, that setting all business aside to day,
I should watch Pamphilus, that I might know what he did about the marriage,
And therefore I follow him now as he comes hither.
I see him just here at hand with Davus. I will mind this business.



How, look about you.

Pamphilus.

Look at him, as if you were not aware of him.

Oh Father.

Well done.

I would have you marry a wife to day, as I told you.

Now I am afraid of our side, what answer this man may make.

You shall find no let in me either in this or any thing else.

How now!



What said he?

You do as becomes you.
Forasmuch as I obtain with a good will, that which I desire of you.

Am not I a true man?

My master, as far as I hear, is fallen short of his wife.

Go thy way in now, lest you make them tarry for you, when need is.

I am going.

That there should be no trust to be had in any man for any thing!

Every man wishes better to himself, then to another.
I have seen that maid, and me thinks I see her yet,
How she is of a lovely feature. Therefore I think the better of Pamphilus,
If he chose rather to sleep with her in his arms himself, then that Charinus
should do so.


HErus me, relictis rebus, juflit Pamphilum body
Observare ut quid ageret de nuptiis,
Scirem. Id propterea nunc huc venientem sequor.
Ipsum adeo praesto video cum Davo. Hoc agam.



Hem, serva.

Pamphile.

Quasi de improviso respice ad cum.

Ehem pater!

Probe.

Body uxorem ducas, ut dixi, volo.

Nunc nostrae timeo parti, quid hic respondeat.

Neque istic neque alibi tibi erit usquam in me mora.

Hem!



Quid dixit?

Facis ut te decet:
Cum istuc quod postulo, impetro cum gratia.

Sum verus?

Herus, quantum audio, uxore decidit.

I nunc jam intro, no in mora, cum opus sit, sies.

Eo.

Nullane in re esse la cuiquam fidem!

Omnes sibi mall melius esse, quam alteri.
Ego illam vidi virginem: forma bona
Memini videre, quo aequior sum Pamphilo,
Si se illam in somnis, quam illum amplecti maluit.


THis man now think's that I bring some tricks to deceive you,
And that I have tarried here for that purpose.

What saith Davus?

As much now as I did before.

Nothing, ha.

Nothing at all.

But indeed I expected you would say something.



Can you tell me the truth?

Nothing more readily.

Doth this marriage any whit at all trouble him,
In respect of his familiarity with this strange woman?

Not a jot indeed: or if it do so, this dumpishness will but be

For he hath very well considered the matter with himself.

I commend him.

Whilst it was lawful for hin, and his age permitted,
He minded love matters, and that but privately; he had a care that that matter
Should never bring him any disgrace, as it becomes a Gentleman to do.


He seemed to me to look somewhat heavily on it.

Not a whit for this matter; but there is something that he is not well pleased
with you for.

What is it?

It is but a childish business.

What is it?

Nothing.

But tell me what it is?

He saith you are too sparing in your cost.

What I!

Yes you.

Which of my Companions shall I invite to my supper?
Especially now: and that which may be here spoken betwixt you and me,
You deal too too nigardly, I do not commend you.

Hold your peace.

I have vex't his patience.

I will see that those things be done as they should be.

For if there be any mischief here, to be sure, he is the author of it.

HIc nunc me credit aliquam sibi fallaciam
Portare, ea me hic restitisse gra^.

Quid Davus narrat? D. Aeque quicquam nunc quidem.

Nihi no, hem?

Nihil prorsus. S. Atqui expectabam quidem.



Poresne mihi verum dicere?

Nihil facilius.

Number illi molesiae quippiam have sunt nuptiae,
Propter hujusce hospitae consuetudinem?

Nihil hercle: aut si adeo, bidui aut tridui est

Etenim secum ipse eam rem recta reputavit via,

Laudo.

Dum licitum est ei, dum{que} aetas tulit,
Amavit, tum id clam, cavit no unquam infamiae
Ea res sibi esset, ut virum fortem decer.


Subtristis visus est esse aliquantum mihi.

Nihil propter hanc rem; sed est quod succenseat tibi.

Quidnam est?

Puerile est.

Quid est?

Nihil.

Quin dic quid est?

Ait nimium parce facere sumptum.

Mene?

Te.

Quem inquit, vocabo ad coenam meorum aequalium
Potissimum nunc? quod dicendum hic siet,
Tu quo{que} perperce nimium, non laudo.

Tace.

Commovi animum.

Ego istaec recte ut fiant videro.

Nam si hic mali est quicquam, hem illic est huic rei caput.

IN troth it is just as you said, Lesbia:
One shall very hardly find a man that is true to a woman.

This maid belongs to the Andrian woman. What say you?

Yes.

But this Pamphilus.

What saith he?

Hath made his word good.

What?



For he gave order it should be put to Nurse, what ever she was delivered on.

O Jupiter,
What's this I hear? the matter is past remedy, if she speak the truth.

You show him to be a good natured young man.

Passing good;
But follow me, lest you make her stay for you.

I follow you.



What means this?
Is he so mad, as to have a child by a strange woman? now I understand the
matter: ah!
That much ado to find it out all this while, like a blockhead that I am:

What doth he say he hath found out?

This fellow first offers to put this ^navish trick upon me.
They make as though this woman was brought abed, that may fright Chremes.

Juno Lucina help me, save me, I beseech thee.

Whoo, so quickly? a fond device. After she heard that I stood
Before the door, she makes hast; O Davus, these things
Were not well enough contrived by you according to their times.

By me?

You have not forgot your Scholar.

I know not what you say.


In a real marriage, what pranks would he have played me?
Now it is done upon his peril, I sail in a safe harbour.

IT a pol quidem res est ut dixti, Lesbia:
Fidelem haud ferme mulieri invenies virum.

Ab Andria an illa est haec. Quid narras?

Ita est.

Sed hic Pamphilus.

Quid dicit?

Firmavit fidem.

Hem?



Nam quod peperisset, jussit rolli.

O Jupiter,
Quid ego audio! actum est, siquidem haec vera praed cat.

Bonum ingenium narras adole scentis.

Optimum.
Sed la me intio, no in mola illi sis.

Sequor.



Quid hoc?
Adcon' est demens? experegrina? jam scio, ah!
Vix tandem sensi stolidus.

Quid hic sensisse ait?

Haec primum affertur jam mihi ab hoc fallacia.
Hanc simulant parere, quo Chremetem absterreant.



Hui, tam cito? Rid culum. Postquam ante ostium
Me audivit stare, approperat; non sat commode
Divisa sunt temporibus tibi, Dave, haec.

Mih^n'?

Non immemor es discipuli.

Ego quid narres, nescio.


Adortus esset, quos mihi ludos redderet?
Nunc hujus pericuolo fit, Ego navigo in portu.

ARchillis, I see hitherto she hath all signs of health Which are usual and
ought to be to a woman in her case.
Now first and foremost see that she wash; and then afterwards
Give her that to drink which I appointed, and give her as much as I had you:
Pamphilus
Hath a jolly chopping boy born him. I pray God be may be long-lived, seeing
He is such a good natured man, and seeing he was loath
To offer any wrong to this very good young woman.

Now who that knows thee, would not think this to be a trick of thy devising?



She could not give order face to face, for what was fit
To be done to one in child-bed; but after she is come forth, she calls out
From the strect-way to them that are within-doors. O Davus, am I so slighted
by you?
Or do I seem at last to be so fit a man for you, as that you should begin so
openly
To put tricks upon me? You might at least have carried it more handsomely,


Certainly forsooth
This man now cousins himself, not I.

Did not I tell you?
I charged you, you should not do it. Did you stand in awe of me? What good
hath it done thee?
Do I now believe thee this, that this womon is brought in bed of a child by
Pamphilus?

I perceive wherein he is mistaken, and I know what to do.

Why do you not speak?



Did any body tell me?

What then, did you your self find out that this was feigned?

Am I made a fool on?

Some body told you, for how could you come to suspect it?

How? because I knew thee.

As if he should say that was done by my device.

For I am sure of it.

Simo, You do not sufficiently know me yet what a man I am.



But if I begin to tell you any thing, you presently
Suppose I go about to cousin you.

Unjustly.

And therefore I dare not open my lips.

This one thing I am sure on, that no woman is brought abed here.

Have you understood so much?
Yet nevertheless they will bring a child hither before the door.
Master, I now tell you that it will come to pass, that you may know it,
Davus's counsel or craft,
I would have this ill opinion which you have of me to be quite taken away.

How do you know it?

I heard it, and I believe it. Many things withal concur, which cause me to
guess thus. She now hath said first that she was with child
By Pamphilus; it is a false thing invented; and now after that she sees

Was sent to fetch a Midwife to her, and to bring a child withal.
Unless it come to pass that you see the child, the marriage is not hindered.

What say you? when you perceived they plotted such a thing, why did you not
forthwith tell
Pamphilus?

Why then who else withdrew him from her; but I?

Now he desires he may have a wife; to conclude, let me alone with the matter,
and do you nevertheless
Go on to make up this match as you do, and hope God will prosper you.

Well then, go thou in a door, and there tarry for me, and provide what is
fitting to be provided.
He hath not enforced me wholly to believe these things, yet I know not

Which my son hath promised me. Now will I meet Chremes, and entreat
For a wife for my son; if I prevail; what should I desire else, but
That the marriage may be to day? for if my son will not do what
He hath promised, I make no question but I can force him to it;
And look where Chremes himself comes toward me in the very nick of time.

ADhuc, Archillis, quae adsolent, quae{que} oportent
Signa esse ad salutem, omnia huic esse video.
Nunc primum fac istaec ut lavet: post deinde
Quod jussi, ei date bibere, quantum imperavi, date.

Pamphilo. Deos quaeso, ut sit superstes, quandoquidem
Ipse est ingenio bono, cum{que} huic veritus est
Optumae adolescenti facere injuriam.

Vel hoc quis non credat, quite norit, abs te esse ortum?



Non imperabat coram quid opus facto esset
Puerperae; sed postquam egressa est, illis, quae sunt intus clamat
De via. O Dave, itane contemnor abs te, aut itane
Tandem idoneus tibi videar esse, quem tu aperte
Fallere incipias dolis? Saltem accurate, ut metui


Certe hercle
Nunc ipsus se fallit, haud ego.

Dixin'tibi?
Interminatus sum, no faceres: number veritus? quid retulit?
Credon' tibi hoc nunc, peperisse hanc e Pamphilo?

Teneo quid erret; quid agam, habeo.

Quid taces?



Mihin' quisquam?

Eho, an tute intellexti hoc adsimularier?

Irrideor?

Renunciatum est; nam qui istaec incidit tibi suspicion?

Qui? quia te noram.

Quasi tu dicas, factum id consilio meo.

Certe enim scio.

Non satis me pernosti etiam qualis sim, Simo.



Sed si quid tibi narrare cepi, continuo dari
Tibi verba censes.

Falso.

Ira{que} hercle nihil mutire jam. audeo.

Hoc ego scio unum, neminem peperisse hic.

Intellextin'?
Sed nihilo secius puerum deferent huc ante ostium.
Id ego nunc tibi, here, renuncio futurum, ut sis sciens:

Prorsus a me opinionem tuam esse ego amotam volo.

Unde id scis?

Audivi credo. Multa concurrunt simul,
Qui conjecturam nunc hanc facio. Jam prius haec se e Pamphilo
Gravidam dixit esse; inventum est falsum: nunc postquam videt

Obstetricem accersitum ad eam, puerum ut asserat simul:
Hoc nisi fit, puerum ut tu videas, nihil moventur nuptiae.

Quid ais? cum intellexeras id consilii capere, cur non dixti extemplo
Pamphilo?

Quis igitur eum ab illa abstraxit nisi ego?

Uxorem expetit; postremo id mihi da negotii, tu tamen has
Nuptias perge facere, ita ut facis, id spero adjuturos deos.

Imo, abi intro; ibi me operire, quod parato opus est, para.
Non impulit me haec omnino ut crederem, at{que} haud scio

Quod mihi pollicitus est ipse gnatus. Nunc Chremetem co^eniam, orabo
Gnato uxorem si impetro, quid alias malim, quam body fiori
Has nuptias? nam gnatus quod pollicitus est, haud dubium id mihi;
Si nolit, quin eum merito possim cogere;


I Bid you good marrow Chremes.

O you are the man I sought for.

And I for you.

You come at a wish: There were some came to me
Who said they heard it from you, that my daughter should be married
To your son to day; I come to see whether you or they be out of your wits.


I hear you. Speak what you have a mind to say.

I entreat you for Gods sake, and for our friendship, Chremes,
Which begun when we were little ones, and hath grown up together with our age;
And for your only daughters sake, and my sons sake,

That you would help me in this matter, and like as
The marriage should have been, so that it may be made.

Ah, do not entreat me;
As though you must obtain this of me by entreating.
You take me to be another kind of man now, then heretofore, when I promised
her.

But if there be more harm then good in this matter
To both, I entreat you to consult for the good of all parties,
As if she were your daughter, and I Pamphilus's father.

Yea Chremes so I mean, and desire that it may be so effected.


What is it?

There is a falling out betwixt Glycerie and my son.

I hear you.

So great that I hope they may be parted.

These are but tales.

Truly it is so.

So indeed as I will tell you,
The falling out of lovers is the renewing of love.


And whilst his hot love is stopped by their bitter speeches,
Before these women's rogueries and tears feigned through wiles
Work his weak mind again to compassion of them.
Let us give him a wife; I hope Chremes, that he being engaged by use of
company and honest wedlock,


It seems so to you; but I think it cannot be,
That either he should continue with her, or that I should abide it.

How then do you know that, before you have made trial?



Verily, all the worst that can be comes but to this at last,
If it should come to pass, which God forbid, a divorce;
But if he shall be reformed, see how many good things come of it;
First and foremost, you shall restore his son to your friend,


What say you so? if you be persuaded that this is so expedient,
I should be loath to hinder you of any good turn I can do you.

Chremes, I have for good reason always loved you more then any man

But what say you?

What?

How know you that they are now fallen out


Davus himself who is very privy
To their counsels, told me, and he persuades me
To hasten on the marriage as fast as I can. Do you think
He would do it, except be knew my son desire these same things?
Besides you shall hear what he saith. Ho,
Davus forth hither. But l^ I see him coming out of doors.

IUbeo Chremetem.

O, teipsum quaerebam.

Et ego te.

Optato advenis. Aliquot adierunt me
Exte auditum, qui aiebant body filiam meam
Nubere gnato tuo; id viso, tun' an illi insaniant.


Skies.

Ausculto, loquere quid velis.

Per ego te Deos oro, nostram amicitiam, Chreme,
Quae incepta a parvis cum aetate accrevit simul,
Perque unicam gnatam tuam gnatum meum,

Ut me adjuves in hac re, atque ita, ut nuptiae
Fuerant futurae, fiant.

Ah, no me obsecra,
Quasi hoc te orando imperare a me oporteat.
Alium esse censes nunc me at{que} olim cum dabam?

Sed si ex ea re plus mali est quam commodi
Utri{que}; id te oro in commune ut consulas,
Quasi illa tua sit, Pamphili{que} ego sim pater.

Immo ita volo, ita{que} postulo ut fiat, Cheme,


Quid est?

Irae sunt inter Glycerium gnatum.

Audio,

Ita magnae ut sperem posse avelli.

Fabulae.

Profecto sic est.

Sic hercle ut dicam tibi,
Amantium itae amoris integratio est..

Dum{que} ejus libido occlusa est contumeliis,
Prius quam harum scelera lachrymae confictae dolis*
Reducant animum aegrotum ad misericordiam;
Uxorem demus; spero confuetudine

Dein facile ex illis sese emersurum malis.

Tibi ita hoc videtur; at ego non posse arbitror,
Neque illum hanc perpetuo habere, neque me perpeti.

Qui scis ergo istuc, nisi periculum feceris?



Nempe incommoditas deni{que} huc omnis redit,
Si eveniat, quod dii prohibeant, discessio.
At si corrigetur, quot commoditates vide.
La, amico filium restitueris,


Quid istuc? si ita istuc animum induxti esse utile,
Nolo tibi ullum commodum in me claudier.

Merito te semper maxumi feci, Chreme.

Sed quid ais?

Quid?

Qui scis eos nunc inter se


Ipsus mihi Davus, qui intimus est
Eorum consiliis, dixit, is mihi persuadet
Nuptias quantum queam ut maturem. Number censes
Faceret, filium nisi sciret eadem haec velle?
Tute adeo jam ejus audies verba. Heus,


I Was coming to you.

What is the matter?

Why is not the Bride sent for?
It draws towards night already.

Do you hear him, Davus! I was erewhile
Something afraid of you, lest you should do as the common sort of servants
Are wont, that you deceive me by knavish tricks, because my son is in love.



I thought so, and therefore fearing it
I concealed from you, that which I will now tell you.

What is it?

You shall know, for I dare now
Almost trust you.

Do you know at last what a man I am?

This marriage was not to have been.

What not?

But I dissembled for this reason, that I might try you.

What say you?

It is just so.



Hear me this, As soon as I bade you go in hence, this man
Met me very fitly.

What are we quite undone?

I told him those things
Which you told me erewhile.

What do I hear?

I entreat him
To bestow his daughter, and with much ado I prevailed.

I am undone.

How now, what said you?



Now there is no stop in him.

I will go home now, and bid things be got ready, and bring word hither again.
Now Davus, I entreat you, seeing thou alone hast brought this marriage to pass
for me.

I alone indeed.

Endeavour a little further to reform my son.

Truly I will do the best I can.

You may do it now, whilst he is nettled.



Do it then; where is be now?

It is a marvel if he be not at home.

I will go to him, and tell him these same things just as I told you.

I am an undone man. What shall hinder me from going straightway
Hence into the house of correction? No entreaty will serve. I have set all out
order.
I have deceived my master, I have thrown my masters son on a marriage,
Pamphilus's mind. Fie upon
Craft! But if I could have been quiet, no harm had happened; but
Lo I see him himself; I wish I had some place here, whence I might throw my
self headlong.

A Dre^ibam.

Quidnam est?

Cur non uxor accersitur?
Jam ad vesperascit.

Audin' tu illum? Ego dudum nonnihil
Veritus sum, Dave, abste, no faceres idem quod vulgus servorum
Solet, dolis ut me deluderes, propterea quod amat filius.



Credidi, id{que} adeo metuens
Vos celavi, quod nunc dicam.

Quid?

Skies, nam propemodum
Habeo tibi jam fidem.

Tandem cognovisti qui siem?

Non fuerunt nuptiae futurae.

Quid non?

Sed ea gratia
Simulavi, vos ut pertentarem.

Quid ais?

Sic res est.


Callidum!

Hoc audi. Ut hinc te introire jussi, opportune
Hic fit mihi obviam.

Hem, numnam perimus?

Narrow huic quae tu
Dudum narrasti mihi.

Quidnam audio?

Gnatam ut det,
Oro, vix{que} id exoro.

Occidi.

Hem, quid dixisti?



Nunc per hunc nulla est mora.

Domum modo ibo; ut apparentur dicam, at{que} huc renuncio

Nunce te oro, Dave, quum solves mihi effecisti has nuptias.

Ego vero solves.

Corrigere mihi gnatum pot^o enitere.

Faciam hercle sedulo.

Potes nune dum animus irritatus est.



Age igitur: ubi nunc est ipsus?

Mirum, ni domi est.

Ibo ad eum, atque eadem haec quae tibi dixi, dicam itidem illi.

Nullus sum. Quid causae est, quin hinc in pistrinum recta
Proficiscar via? Nihil preci loci relictum est. Jam perturbavi omnia.
Herum fefelli, in nuptias conjeci herilem filium, Feci body

Astutias! quod si quiessem, nihil evenisset mihi; sed eccum ipsum
Video, video; utinam mihi esset aliquid hic, quo nunc me praecipitem darem.

WHere is that Varlet, that hath undone me?

I am undone.

Yet I confess,
This hath justly befallen me, because I am so sottish, and so void
Of counsel: O that I should commit my fortunes to a prating slave!
There am I rightly served for my folly: but he shall never go scot-free with
it.



For what shall I now say to my father? shall I say I will not marry her, who
have but lately promised to do so?
With what confidence should I dare to do it? Neither do I know
What I should now do with my self.

Nor I with my self, and yet I do what I can about it.
I will tell him I will find out some remedy by and by, that I may make this
punishment be delayed.



I am seen.

Come hither good Sir, what say you?
Do you not see how I poor man am entangled by your advice?

But I will rid you by and by.

Will you rid me?

Yes indeed, Pamphilus.

Forsooth as you did lately.

Nay, better I hope.

Oh, how should I credit you, you rogue? will you recover a matter
Full of trouble, and past help? Alas, what a fellow have I relied on,

Did not I tell you that this would come to pass?

You told me.

What have you deserved?

The gallows.
But if I may but come to my self a little, I will presently find some remedy.

Wo is me,
That I have no space to punish thee as I desire,
For this time permits me to look to my self, not to be revenged on you.

UBi illie est scelus, qui me perdidit?

Perii.

Atque hoc
Confiteor jure mihi obtigisse, quandoquidem tam iners, tam nullius
Consilii sum. Servon' fortunas meas me commisisse futili:
Ergo pretium ob stultitiam fero; sed in ultum id nunquam auferet.



N^m quid ego nunc dicam patri? negabon' velle me, modo qui sum
Pollicitus ducere? Qua fiducia facere id audeam? nec quid me
Nunc faciam scio.

Nec quid de me, atque id ago sedulo.
Dicam aliquid me jam inventurum, ut huic malo aliquam producam


Ohe.

Visus sum.

Ehodum bone vir, quid ais?
Viden' me tuis consiliis miserum impeditum esse.

At jam expediam.

Expedies?

Certe, Pamphile.

Nempe ut modo.

Immo melius
Spero.

Oh, tibi ego ut credam, furcifer? Tu rem impeditam
Et perditam restitues? hem, quo fretus sim, qui me body

Dixi esse hoc futurum?

Dixti.

Quid meritus es?

^rucem.
Sed si paululum ad me redeam, jam aliquid despiciam.

Hei mihi,
Cum non habeo spatium ut de te sumam suppilcium ut volo:
Nam{que} hoc tempus praecavere mihi, haud te ulcisci sinit.

IS this a thing to be believed or mentioned, that so match peevishness
Should be bred in any man, as to delight in mischief, and seek to get His own
commodity by another discommodity? Alas, is it true? Yea, That is the worst
kind of men, who have a little shame now and then in denying;
Afterwards when it is time that their promises should be performed, then
Being forced they have no way but to lay open themselves, and they are loath,
yet the matter drives them to deny.
Then is their speech most shameleless; Who are you? What are you to me?
Why should you desire to have my sweetheart? Do you hear Sir, I am my own next
neighbour: Yet for all this, if you ask,
Where is faith? they are ashamed of nothing. Here where there is need, they
are not afraid; there where is no
Need, they are afraid: But what should I do? Should I go to him
And take him up for this injury? I shall give him many shrewd words, But may
some body say,
You will do no good: I shall be sure to trouble him sufficiently
And ease my own mind.

Charinus, I have undone you and my self unawares,
Except God look upon us.

Yes, forsooth, unawares.
You have got an excuse now at last, you have broke your promise.

What now at last?

Yea you desire to deceive me now with these words.

What is the matter?

After I told you that I was in love with Philumena, she pleased you. Wo is me
poor man,
Who esteemed your mind by my own.

You are mistaken.

Did not this
Joy seem to you solid enough, except you must call me on being in love, (...).
And draw me on with vain hope? You may take her.

I take her? ^ as you know not in what troubles I am, and what cares this
bangman ^mine hath wrought me by his projects.

What is that ^such strange matter, he takes example by you?

You would not (...) so,
If you either understood me, or my love.

I know you chid with your father
Erewhile, and he is angry with you for it, neither could he force you to day
To marry her.

Nay indeed, whereby you do not so well apprehend my grief,
This marriage was not intended for me, nor did any man desire now
To give me a wife.

I know you are compelled by your own will.

Tarry,
You do not yet know.

I know certainly, that you will marry her.

Why do you kill me?
Hear me this; he never gave over to urge, to persuade,
And entreat me to tell my father I would marry her, and so far until he
enforced me to it.

What fellow did that?

Davus.

Davus?

He sets all on heaps.

Why did he so?

I know not, except I think God was offended with me;
Because I gave ear to him.

Did you do this, Davus?

I did it.

Ha, what do you say, you rogue? But God give thee an ill end answerable to thy
doings.
Come on, tell me if all his enemies would have thrown upon a marriage,
What other advice then this, could they give him?

I am deceived, but not discouraged.

I know it.

It hath no success this way, we will try another way; unless you think this,
Because it succeeded not well at the first, this mischief cannot
Be remedied.

Yes indeed, for I verily believe, if you set your self to it,
You will make me two marriages of one.

I, Pamphilus,
Ow you this, as I am your servant, to strive with might and main, night
And day to adventure my life to do you good. It is your part
To pardon me if any thing have happened besides what we looked for. That which I
did, had no good success; yet I do
The best that I can. Or do you find a better remedy, and let me alone.

I am content. Set me again in what condition you found me:

I will do it.

But it must be done presently.

Ho, whist, stay a little, Glyceries door creaks.

That is nothing to you.

I am devising a way.

What now at the last?

But I will find a device for you by and by.

HOccine est credibile aut memorabile, tanta vecordia cuiquam
Innata ut siet, ut malis gaudeat, atque ex incommodis
Alterius sua ut comparet? Ah, idne est verum? Immo
Id est genus hominum pessimum, in denegando modo quis pudor

Necessario se aperiunt, timent: tamen res premit eos denegare.
Ibi tum eorum impudentissima oration est. Quis tu es? quis mihi es?
Cur meam tibi? Heus, Proximus sum egomet mihi. Attamen ubi fidis
Si roges? nihil pudet. Hic ubi opus est non verentur: illic ubi nihil

Injuriam hanc expostulem: ingeram multa mala, atque aliquis
Dicat, nihil promoveris. Multum molestus certe ei fuero,
At{que} animo morem gessero.

Charine, te me imprudens
Perdidi, nisi quid dii respiciunt.

Itane imprudens?


Quid tandem?

Etiam nunc me ducere his dictis postulas.

Quid istuc est?

Postquam me amare dixi, complacita est tibi. H^u me miserum,
Qui tuum animum spectavi ex animo meo.

Falsus es.

Nonne tibi
Satis esse hoc visum solidum est gaudium, nisi me lact asses amantem,


Habeam? ah nescis quantis
In malis verser miser; quanta^{que} hic suis consiliis mihi
Confecit soilic tudines meus carnifex.

Quid istuc
Tam mitum est, de te si exemplum capit?

Haud istuc dicas,
Si cognoris vel me, vel amorem meum.

Scio cum patre altercasti.

Illam ut duceres.

Immo etiam, quo tu minus scis aerumnas meas,
Have nuptiae non apparabantur mihi, nec postulabat nunc quisquam
Uxorem dare.

Scio tu coactus tua voluntate es.

Mane.
Nondum scis.

Scio equidem illam ducturum esse te.

Cur me enecas?

Patri, suadere, orare; usque adeo donec perpulit.

Quis homo
Istuc?

Davus.

Davus?

Interturbat omnia.

Quamobrem?

Nescio nisi mihi D^s satis scio fuisse iratos
Quia auscultaverim.

Factum hoc est, Dave?

Factum.

Eho, dic mihi, si omnes hunc conjectum in nuptias inimici vellent,
Quod nisi hoc, consilium darent?

Deceptus sum, at non defatigatus.

Scio.

Hac non succedit; alia aggrediemur via: nisi id putas.
Quia primo processit parum, non posse jam ad salutem converti


Immo etiam: nam satis credo, fi advigilaveris,
Ex unis geminas mihi conficies nuptias.

Ego, Pamphile,
Hoc tibi pro servitio debeo, conari pedibus manibus, noctes{que}
Dies, capitis periculum adire, dum prosim tibi. Tuum est siquid praeter
S^em evenit, mihi ignoscere. Parum succedit quod ago: at facio


Cupio. Restitue quem a me accepisti locum.

Faciam.

At jam hoc opus est.

Hem, 'st, manc: concrepuit a Glycerio ostium.

Nihil ad te.

Quaero.

Nunccine demum?

At jam hoc tibi inventum dabo.

WHere ever he shall be, I will take care to find out your Pamphilus
For you, and bring him with me presently; only my dear, do not vex your self.

Mysis.

What is the matter?

Pamphilus, you meet me in very good time.

What is the matter?

My Mistress
Bade me entreat you, to come to her, if you love her. She saith she hath a
desire to see you.


Should be thus disquieted now by thy means? For I am therefore sent for,
because she perceives that I am abont to be married. Which indeed how easily
might it have passed quietly,
If this fellow had been quiet?

Go to, if he be not mad enough of himself, set him on.

And truly that is the cause why the poor woman is in sorrow.

Mysis, I swear to you by all the Gods, that I will never forsake her, no not
if I wist
I should ma^e all men living my enemies. I have desired to have her, see it is
fallen to my lot.
Our dispositions are alike; let them be jogging that would make discord
betwixt us.
None but death shall part her from me.

I begin to come to my self.

Apollo's answer is not
More true than this I say, if it may be so carried, that my Father may not

Cannot be, I will go the readiest way to work, though he think I was the cause
to hinder it.
What a man do I seem to be?

As a very a wretch as my self.

I am devising a Plot.

In other men's matters.

I know what you would fain do.

Truly, I will be sure to dispatch this for you.

This must now be done.

But I have it now.

What is it?

I have it for this man, and not for thee:


I have enough.

What will you do? tell me.

I am afraid this day will
Scarce be enough for me to do my business, Do not think I am now at leisure to
tell you.
And therefore get you away hence, for you do but hinder me.

I will go see her.

What do you? whither do you go, hence?

Would you have me say the truth?

Nay forsooth, he begins to tell me a tale of a tub.



Why you shameless fellow: have you not enough that I gave you
A small days respite, in that I prolong the marriage for him?

Yet for all this, Davus.

What then.

That I may marry her.

You coxcomb.

See
You come hither to me, if you can do any thing.

What should I come for? I can do nothing.

Nevertheless, if you can do any thing,

Well, I will come.

If you can do any thing I will be at home.

Mysis, do you tarry here a little, whilst I come forth again.

Why so?

You must needs do so.

Make haste.

I will be here, I say, by and by.

I Am ubi ubi erit, inventum tibi curabo, mecum adductum
Tuum Pamphilum: tu modo, anime mi, noli te macerare.

Mysis.

Quid est? hem Pamphile, optume mihi te offers.

Quid est?

Orare
Jussit, si se ames, heta, ut ad sese venias. Videre ait te cupere.


Nunc miseros sollicitariet? Nam idcirco accersor, nuptias quia mihi
Apparari sensit.

Quibus quidem quam facile poterat quiesci,
Si hic qui esset.

Age, si hic non insanit satis sua sponte, inst^ga.

Atque aedipol ea res est, propterea{que} misera in maerore est.


Mihi sciam esse inimicos omnes homines. Hanc mihi expetivi, contigit,
Conveniunt mores, valiant qui inter nos dissidium volunt.
Hanc nisi mors mihi adimet nemo.

Resipisco.

Non Apollinis
Magis verum atque hoc responsum est. Si poterit fieri ut no pater pro me

Poterit, id faciam in proclive quod est, per me stetisse ut credat.

Quis videor!

Miseraeque atque ego.

Consilium quaero.

For as.

Scio quid conere.

Hoc ego tibi profecto effectum reddam.

Jam hoc opus est.

Quin jam habeo.

Quid est?

Huic, non tibi, habeo.


Sat habeo.

Quid facies, cedo?

Dies hic mihi
Ut satis sit vereor ad agendum, no vacuum esse nunc me ad narrandum,
Credas. Proinde, hinc vos amolimini. Nam impedimento estis.

Ego hanc visam.

Quid tu? quo hinc te agis?

Verum vis
Dicam?

Immo etiam, narrationis incipit mihi initium,



Eho tu impudens non satis habes quod tibi
Dieculam addo, quantum huic promoveo nuptias.

Dave, attamen.

Quid ergo?

Ut ducam.

Ridiculum.

Hoc fac^
Ad me ut venias, si quid poteris.

Quid veniam? nihil habeo.

Attamen si quid.

Age, ego veniam.

Si quid, domi ere.

Mysis, dum exeo, parumper me operire hic.

Quapropter?

Ita facto opus est.

Matura.

Jam, inquam, adero hic.

IS there nothing that one can be sure on? O wonderful strange!
I thought this Pamphilus was my Mistresses greatest comfort,
As being her friend, sweetheart, husband, and one ready to serve her
Upon all occasions: but what pain doth the poor woman endure because of him!

But Davus comes forth; my good friend, what is that I pray you?
Whither do you carry the child?

NIhilne esse proprium cuiquam? Dii vestram fidem!
Summum bonum esse herae putavi hunc Pamphilum,
Amicum, amatorem, virum in quovis loco
Paratum: verum ex eo misera quem capit

Sed Davus exit; mi homo, quid istuc obsecro est?
Quo portas puerum?

MYsis, I have now need
Of your ready feat and cunning for this matter.

What are you going to do?

Take this child of me quickly,
And lay it before our gate.

What I pray you,


Take thee some strewing-herbs hence from off this altar,
Amd straw them under it.

Why do you not do it your self?

Because, if perhaps I be driven to swear to my Master,
Thal I laid it not there, that I may do it safely.

I understand you:
But tell me, how came you to be so very scrupulous?


O Jupiter!

What now?

The Brides farther prevents me;
I leave off the purpose which I first intended.

I know not what you say.

I will make as though I came
Here hence on the right hand thee; do you see that you hold up

I do not at all understand what you mean to do; but if there be any thing
Wherein you may stand in need of my help, or you see more then I,
I will tarry, that I may not hinder you in any thing that may do you good.

-- MYsis, nunc opus est tua
Mihi ad hanc rem exprompta militia at{que} astutia.

Quidnam incepturus es?

Accipe a me hunc ocyus,
At{que} ante nostram januam appone.

Obsecro,


Ex ara hinc sum verbenas tibi,
At{que} eas substerne.

Quamobrem id tute non facis?

Quia si forte opus sit ad herum jusjurandum mihi,
Non apposuisse, ut liquido possim.

Intelligo.
Nova nunc religio in te istaec incessit, cedo.


Pro Jupiter!

Quid?

Sponsae pater intervenit;
Repudio consilium quod primum intenderam.

Nescio quid narres.

Ego quoque hinc ab dextra
Venire me adsimulabo; tu, ut subservias

Ego, quid agas, nihil intelligo: sed si quid est
Quod mea opera opus sit vobis, aut tu plus vides,
Manebo, no quid vestrum remorer commodum.

NOw I come back again, after I have provided what was fitting
For my daughters wedding, that I may bid her be sent for. But what is this?
Verily it is a child.
Woman, did you lay this child here?

Where is this fellow?

Doest thou not
Answer me?

Alas, he is nowhere to be seen: Wo is me, poor woman!
The man hath left me, and is gone away.

O wondrous strange!
What an hurly-burly there is in the market? what a sort of men are brabbling
there?
Besides provision is dear, I know not what I should say.

Why do you leave me here alone, I pray you?

How now, what tale is this?
Ey but Mysis, whose is this child? or who brought it hither?



Whom else should I ask?
That see no body else here.

I wonder whose it should be!

Will you tell me what I ask you, or not?

Ah,

Come hither on my right hand.

You dote; did not you your self lay it there? you had best take heed
You do not speak one word besides those that I ask you.



Whence is't? speak aloud.

From us.

Ha, ha, he.
It is a wonder indeed if a woman that is a whore deal shamelessly.

This maid belongs to the woman of Andros, as far as I can perceive.

Do we seem to be so fit persons for you to play upon?

I came in time.

Make haste withal to take away the child hence from the gate;


A mischief light on thee, thou doest so terrify me poor woman.

Do I speak to you or no?

What would you have?

Do you yet stand to ask?
Deal plainly, whose child have you laid here? tell me.

Do not you know?

Let what I know alone, and tell me what I ask.



Whose yours?

Pamphilus's.

How now, what? Pamphilus's?

Why, is it not?

I did well always to avoid this marriage.

O villain, that deserves to be punished!

Why do you exclaim?

Which child? was not it brought to you yesternight in the evening?

O thou bold-faced fellow!

But I saw Canthara


Truly, I thank God
That some free-women were at her delivery.

Truly, she doth not well know him, for whose cause she begins these things.
If Chremes (thinks she) shall see a child laid before the door,
He will not give his daughter: but he will the rather give her.

Truly he will not.

Moreover, now that you may know my mind,
Unless you take away the child, I will tumble him into the middle of the way,
And I will tumble you there in the dirt.

Truly thou art not a man in thy wits.

One piece of knavery Discovers another. I hear it whispered now amongst them

That this Glycerie is a Citizen of Athens.

What now?

He shall
Be forced by the Law to marry her.

Why I pray you, is she not a Citizen?

I was almost fallen upon a merry mischief at unawares.

Who talks here? O Chremes, you come in very good time;
Do you hearken?

I have heard all.

Have you heard all these things?

I have heard all I say from the beginning.

Have you heard I pray you?
O the rogueries! It is fit this woman should be had hence to the house of
correction.
This is he: do not think that you make a fool of Davus.

Wo is me, poor woman! my old Master, I have spoken nothing untrue.

I know the whole matter. But is Simo within?

He is.

You villain, do not meddle with me; If I do not tell Glycerie all these things
--

Away, you silly woman, you perceive not what is done.

How should I perceive?

This is the Brides Father, it could not otherwise be brought about
That he should know th^se things we would have him.

You should have told me before-hand.

Do you think there is but small difference whether you do all by hab nab,
As the nature of them requires, or merely for the nonce?

REvertor jam ego postquam quae opus fuere ad nuptias gnatae,
Paravi, ut jubeam accersi. Sed quid hoc? Puer hercle est.
Mulier, tun' posuisti hunc?

Ubi hic est?

Non
Mihi respondes?

Hem, nusquam est: Vae miserae mihi?
Reliquit me homo at{que} abiit.

Dsi vostram fidem!
Quid turbae est apud forum? Quid illic hominum litigant?
Tum annona chara est; quid dicam, aliud nescio.

Cur tu, obsecro, hic me solam?

Hem, quae est haec fabula?
Eho, Mysis, puer hic unde est? quisve huc attulit?



Quem ego igitur rogem?
Qui hic neminem alium video.

Miror unde sit.

Dicturan' es quod rogo?

A^.

Concede ad dextram.

Deliras; non tute ipse?

Verbum si mihi ullum
Praeterea quam quod rogo, faxis cave.



Unde est? dic clare.

a nobis.

Ha, ha, he.
Mirum vero impudenter mulier si facit meretrix.

Ab Andria est ancilla haec, quantum intelligo.

Adeon'
Videmur vobis esse idonei, in quibus sic illudatis?

Veni in tempore.

Propera adeo puerum tollere hinc ab janua.


Dii te te eradicent, ita me miseram territas.

Tibi ego dico, an non?

Quid vis?

At etiam rogas?
Cedo, cujum puerum hic apposuisti? dic mihi.

Tu nescis?

Mitte quod scio; dic quod rogo.



Cujus vestri?

Pamphili.

Hem, quid? Pamphili?

Eho, Annon est?

Recte ego semper fugi has nuptias.

O facinus animadvertendum!

Quid clamitas?

Quemne ego vidi heri ad vos deferri vesperi?

O hominem audacem!

Verum vidi Cantharam
^0. Subfarcinatam.

Diis pol habeo gratias,
Cum in pariundo aliquae adfuerunt liberae.

Nae illa illum haud novit, cujus causa hoc incipit.
Chremes si puerum positum ante aedes viderit,
Non dabit: tanto herele magis dabit.



Nunc adeo, ut tu sis sciens,
Nisi puerum tollis, jam ego hunc in mediam viam
Pervolvam, te{que} ibidem pervolvam in luto.

Tu pol homo non es sobrius.

Fallacia
Alia aliam trudit. Jam susurrari audio


Hem!

Coactus legibus
Eam uxorem ducet.

Obsecro, eho, annon civis est?

Jocularium in malum insciens pene incidi.

Quis hic loquitur? O Chremes, per tempus advenis.
Ausculta.

Audivi omnia.

An haec tu omnia?



Audistin', obsecro? Hem
Scelera! hanc jam oportet in cruciatum hinc abripi.
Hic est ille: non te credas Davum ludere.

Me mis: ram, nihil pol falsi dixi, mi senex.

Novi omnem rem. Sed est Simo intus?

Est.



Eho, inepta, nescis quid sit actum.

Qui sciam?

Hic socer est, alio pacto haud poterat fi^ri,
Ut sciret haec quae volumus.

Praediceres.

Paululum interesse censes, ex animo omn^


I Was told, that Chrysis lived in this street,
Who chose rather to get wealth here dishonestly,
Then to live poor and honestly in her own country,
Her goods are fallen to me by her death.
But I see some of whom I may ask. God save you.

I pray you,
Whom do I see? Is not this Crito, Chrysis her full cousin?
It is he.

O Mysis, God save you.

God save you, Crito.

Is it so, is Chrysis dead? Ha!

She hath undone us poor women.

How do you? How do you live? Is all well with you?

What we?
We do as we can, as they say, when we cannot do as we would.

What doth Glycerie? hath she yet found out her parents here?

I would she had.

What not yet? I came hither unluckily;
For truly had I known that, I would never have set foot hither;
For she was always reported and held to be her sister,
She is in possession of what was Chrysis's. Now for me that am but a stranger
to follow suits here,
How easy and profitable it is likely to be, other men's examples forewarn me.
Besides I suppose she hath now some friend or guardian,
For she was almost a grown woman when she went thence, They may cry out on me,

That I like a petty-fogging knave do hunt after another bodies estate, that I
am a beggarly rascal and besides
I may not bereave her of all.

O most honest stranger Crito, indeed you keep your old wont.

Bring me to her, and seeing I am come hither, let me see her.

Yes.

I will follow these folks; I am loath the old man should see me at this time.

IN hac habitasse platea dictum est Chrysidem,
Quae sese inhoneste optavit parare hic divitias,
Potius quam in patria honest pauper vivere.
Ejus morte ad me leg redierunt bona.


Obsecro,
Quem video? Estne hic sobrinus Chrysidis?
Is est.

O Mysis, salve.

Salvus sis, Crito.

Itan' Chrysis? Hem.

Nos quidem pol miseras perdidit.

Qui vos? quo pacto? satin' recte?

Nosne?


Quid Glycerium? jam hic la parents repperit?

Utinam.

An nondum etiam? haud auspicato huc me appuli:
Nam pol si id scissem, nunquam huc tetulissem pedem.
Semper enim dicta est esse haec, atque habita est soror.

Facile atque utile, aliorum exempla commonent.
Simul arbitror jam aliquem esse amicum defensorem ei;
Nam fere grandiuscula jam profecta est illinc, clamitent me
Sycophantem haereditatem persequi, mendicum: tum ipsam despoliare


Optume hospes, pol, Crito, antiquum tenes.

Duc me ad eam, quando huc veni, ut videam.

Maxume.

Sequar hos, nolo ut me tempore hoc videat senex.

NOw, Simo, my friendship towards you hath appeared sufficiently,
I began to undergo danger enough. Now cease your entreating;
Whilst I strive to humour you, I have almost befooled away my daughters life.

Nay rather Chremes, I most earnestly request and desire you,
That you would really perform the kindness erewhile begun.

See how unreasonable you are through earnestness; so you may effect what you
have a mind to,
You neither consider any mean in courtesies, nor what you entreat me.
For if you did consider, you would forbear to burden me with your
unreasonableness.

What, what?

Alas, do you ask? You have forced me
To bestow my daughter on a young man entangled in love with another,
Not enduring to hear of a wife, for discord, and uncertainty of wedlock;
That by her trouble and grief I may cure your son;
You obtained your desire, I began to do it, whilst the matter suffered; and
now it doth not suffer, you must bear with me.
They say she is a Citizen herehence, there a child born, let us alone.

I entreat you for Gods sake, that you would not give your mind to believe
them,
For whom it is most advantageous that he be as bad as bad can be;
All these things are done and undertaken because of the marriage;
When that cause why they do these things shall be taken away, they will be
quiet.

You are mistaken, I my self saw a maid chiding with Davus.

I know it.

But in good earnest, when neither of them knew before-hand that I was there.

I believe it, and Davus told me a while before that the women would do it.
I know not what I have forgot to say to you to day, as I had intended.

SAtis jam satis, Simo, spectata erga te amicitia est mea,
Satis periculi incepi adire; orandi jam finem face.
Dum studeo obsequi tibi, pene illusi vitam filiae.

Immo enim quam maxim abs te oro at{que} postulo, Chremes,
Ut beneficium initum dudum re comprobes.

Vide quam iniquus sis prae studio; dum id effici^s quod cupis,
No{que} modum benignitatis, no{que} quid me ores, cogitas.
Nam si cogites, remittas jam me onerare injuriis.

Quibus?

Ah rogitas? perpulisti me ut la adolescentulo

Filiam darem in seditionem; atque in incertas nuptias;
Ejus labore at{que} dolor gnato ut medicarer tuo.
Impetrasti, incepi dum res tetulit, nunc non fert, feras.
Illam hinc civem esse aiunt, puer est gnatus, nos missos face.


Quibus id maxim utile est, illum esse quam deterrimum.
Nuptiarum gratia haec sunt facta at{que} incepta omnia.
Ubi ea causa, quamobrem haec faciunt, erit adempta his, desinent.

Erras: cum Davo egomet vidi jurgantem ancillam.

Scio.



Credo, id facturas Davus dudum praedixit mihi.
Et nescio quid tibi sum oblitus body ac volui dicere.

I Charge you presently to set your heart at rest.

See where Davus is for you.

Whence comes he forth?

By my means and the strangers.

What mischief is that?

I never saw a fitter man,
A more seasonable coming, nor a better time.

Whom doth the rogue commend here?

Now all is cock-sure.

Do I linger to speak to him?

Here is my Master, what shall I do?

God save you, good Sir.

What now? O our Chremes, all things are ready
Now within.

You have looked to them very well.

Send for the Bride when you will.

Very well indeed:
That is the reason forsooth he is now absent therehence. Withal, do you answer
me this; What business
Have you there?

Who, I?

Yes, you.

I?

I speak to you.

I went but in just now.

As though I asked you how long ago?

With your son.

What is Pamphilus within? I am tormented, poor man.
Why, you rogue, did not you tell me there was a falling out betwixt them?

So there is.

Why is he here then?

What do you think he is doing? he is chiding with her.

Nay, but indeed Chremes you shall hear me tell you a notable strange matter;
I know not what old man is come even now; but to look on, he is a substantial,
understanding man: if you saw his face,
You would deem him a very honest man; there is a settled gravity in his
countenance,
And truth in what he saith.

What news do you bring us?

Nothing indeed
But what I have heard him say.

What saith he then?

That he is sure
That Glycerie is a Citizen of Athens.

Ho, Dromo, Dromo!

What is the matter?



Do but hear me.

If thou speak a word, Dromo.

I pray you, hear me.

What would you have?

Take up this fellow
A good height in a doors, as fast as you can.

Whom?

Davus.

Why so?

Because I list. Take him up, I say.

What have I done?

Take him up.

If you find I have told you any lie, kill me.

I do not hear you.
I will now vex your patience.

Although this be true.

Yea for all that, do you take care to keep him fettered. And do you hear,
Tie the beast neck and heels together. Go to now, I will show you if I live to
day,
What danger it is for you to deceive your Master, and him his Father.

Ah, be not in such a passion.

Chremes, do you not pity me, to see my sons dutifulness towards me,
That I should take so much pains for such a son? Well, Pamphilus; come out
here Pamphilus, are you no whit ashamed?

ANimo nunc jam otioso esse impero.

Hem Davum tibi.

Unde egred^tur?

Meo praesidio atque hospitis.

Quid illud est mali?

Ego commodiorem hominem,
Adventum, tempus non vidi.

Scelus, quemnam hic laudat?



Cesso alloqui?

Herus est, quid agam.

Salve, bone vir.

Ehem, O noster Chremes, omnia apparata sunt
Jam intus.

Curasti probe.

Ubi voles, accerse.

Been sane.
Id enimvero hinc nunc abest. Etiam tu hoc responde, quid istic tibi
Negotii est?

Mihin'?

Ita.

Mihine?

Tibi ego.



Quasi ego quam dudum rogem?

Cum tuo
Gnato una.

Anne est intus Pamphilus? crucior miser.
Eho, number tu dixtin' esse inter eos inimicitias, carnifex?

Sunt.

Cur igitur hic est?

Quid illum censes? cum illa litigat.

Imo vero indignum, Chremes, jam facinus faxo ex me audies.

Videtur esse quantivis pretii; tristis severitas inest in voltu,
Atque in verbis sides.

Quidnam adportas?

Nihil equidem,
Nisi quod illum audivi dicere.

Quid ait tandem?

Glycerium
Se scire civem esse Atticam.

Hem, Dromo, Dromo!

Quid est?



Audi.

Verbum si addideris, Dromo.

Audi, obsecro.

Quid vis?

Sublimem int^ o hunc
Rape, quantum potes.

Quem?

Davum.

Quamobrem?

Quia lubet. Rape, inquam.

Quid feci?

Rape.

Si quicquam invenies mentitum, occidito.

Nihil audio.
Ege jam te commotum reddam.

Tametsi hoc verum est.

Tamen, tu cura adservandum vinctum. At{que} audin quadrupedem
Constringito. Age nunc jam, ego pol body si vivo, tibi ostendam
Herum quid sit pericli fallere, illi patrem.

Ah no saevi tantopere.

Chremes, pietatem gnati! nonne te miseret mei? Tantum


who would speak with me? I am undone, it is my Father.

What say thou of all knaves the worst?

Ah Speak rather to the matter, and forbear to give ill language.

As though any thing can be spoken too ill against this fellow.
Do you say it forsooth, Is Glycerie a Citizen?

So they report.

So they report! O his huge confidence!
Doth he consider what he saith? Is he sorry for what he hath don^.
See whether his colour doth show any sign of bashfulness?
That he should be so weak minded, as contrary to the custom
Of Citizens, and the law, and the mind of his own Father,
He should yet desire to have her to his utter disgrace?

Wo is me, poor man!

Oh Pamphilus, are you now sensible of it at last?
You should have said that long ago, I say long ago, when you so set your
mind,
As you must by any means effect what you had a desire to:
On that very day, that word was truly said of you.
But what do I do? why do I disquiet my self? why do I chase my self?
Why do I trouble my old age with his madness?
Is it that I should undergo the punishment for his faults?
Nay, let him take her, and fare him well; let him live with her.

My Father!

Why my Father? as if you had need of this father.
You have got a house, a wife and children, whether your Father will or no.
There he those brought that may say she is a Citizen: you shall have the
victory.

Father, may I speak a few words?

What will you say to me?

Yet, Simo, hear him.

I hear him? What should I hear him,
Chremes?

Yet let him speak.

Well, let him speak, I give him leave.

I confess I love this woman, and if that be an offence, I confess it too;
Father, I submit my self to you, lay what charge you will upon me, command me.

Will you have me marry, and let this woman go? I will bear it as well as I
can:
Only this I beseech you, that you would not think this old man was brought by
me.
Give me leave to clear my self, and bring him hither before you.

You bring him?

Suffer me, Father.

He desires but what is reason; give him leave.

Let me over-treat you.

I give you leave.
I could be content to yield to any thing, Chremes, so I may not find my self
to be cosened by this son of mine.

A little punishment is satisfaction to a father for a great offence.

QUis me vult? perii, pater est.

Quid ais, omnium?

Ah,
Rem potius ipsam dic; ac mitte male loqui.

Quasi quicquam in hunc gravius dici possit.
Ain' tandem, civis Glycerium est?

Ita praedicant.


Number cogitat, quid dicat? number facti piget?
Vide number ejus color pudoris signum usquam indicat?
Adeon' impotenti esse animo, ut praeter civium
Morem at{que} legem, sui voluntatem patris,


Me miserum!

Hem: modone id demum sensistj, Pamphile?
Olim istuc olim cum ita animum induxisti tuum,
Quod cuperes aliquo pacto efficiundum tibi;
Eodem die istuc verbum vere in te accidit.

Cur meam senectam hujus solicito amentia?
An ut pro hujus peccatis ego supplicium sufferam?
Immo habeat; valeat; vivat cum illa.

Mi pater?

Quid, mi pater? quasi tu hujus indige as patris.
Demus, uxor, liberi inventi, invito patre.
Adducti qui illam civem hinc dicant: viceris.

Pater, licetne pauca?

Quid dices mihi?

Tamen, Simo, audi.

Ego audiam? Quid ego audiam,
Chreme?

Attamen, dicat, fine.

Age, dicat, sino.


Tibi, pater, me dedo; quidvis oneris impende, impera.
Visne uxorem ducere, hanc vis amittere? ut potero, feram:
Hoc modo te obsecro, ut no credas a me allegatum hunc senem.
Sine me expurgem, atque illum huc coram adducam.

Adducas?



Aequum postulat, da veniam.

Sine te exorem.

Sino.
Quidvis cupio, dum no ab hoc me falli comperiam, Chreme.

Pro peccato magno paululum supplicii satis est patri.

FOrbear to entreat me; any one of these reasons persuade me to do it.
Either you, or because it is true, or because I wish well to Glycerie.

Do I see Crito of Andria? truly it is he.

God save you Chremes.

what do you at Athens, that are here so seldom?

It is so fallen out. But is this Simo?

This is he.

Do you ask for me? Why, do you say Glycerie is a Citizen of this place?

Do you deny it?

Do you come hither so well provided?

Why so?

Do you ask?
Do you think to do these things and go unpunished? Do you trapan
Young men here, that are unexperienced in the world, and honestly brought up?
Do you feed their fancies by enticing them on, and giving them fair words?

Are you well in your wits? and do you take them, and their whores together?

I am undone. I am afraid the stranger cannot abide it.

Simo, if you knew this man sufficiently,
You would not judge so. He is an honest man.

Can this be an honest man?
Comes he so very jump to day upon the very nick of the marriage,
That he could never come before now? Must we believe him, Chremes?

B^t that I am afraid of my Father; I have something I could tell him very well
how to answer that matter.

You petty-fogging knave.

What now!

He is as you see, Crito, forbear him.

Let him consider who he is.
If he proceed to say what be list to me, he shall hear what he list not.
Do I meddle with those things, or care for them? Will not you bear your own
grief patiently?
For as concerning what I said, it may be quickly known, whether what you
heard, be true, or false.
An Athenian a good while ago having suffered Shipwreck, was cast a shore at
Andros,
And that little girl with him; Then he being in want by chance,
First betook himself to Chrysis Father.

He begins to tell a tale of a tub.

Let him go on.

Doth he so interrupt me indeed?

Go on.

Beside,
He that entertained him was my Cousin. There I heard it of the man himself,
That he was an Athenian. He died there.

What was his name?

Must I tell you his name so quickly? Phania.

Ah, I am undone.

But truly
I think it was Phania. This I am sure of, he said he was one of Rhamnus.

O Jupiter!

O Chremes, many others in Andros heard
These same words then.

I wish it were as I hope it is, Well tell me
What did he say she was? Did he say she was his daughter?

N^.

Whose then?

His brothers daughter:

Surely she is mine.

What say you?

What
Is that you say?

Listen, Pamphilus.

How, do you believe it?

That Phania was my brother.

I knew the man, and know it was so.

He flying hen^e to avoid the war, and thinking to follow me into Asia,
Made a journey after me, he was then afraid to leave her here.
After those things, this is the first time I ^ear what was become of him.

I am scarce my own man, my mind is so tossed with fear,
And joy, and hope, and wondering at this so great and so s^dden a good hap.

Truly I am glad that she is so many ways found to be your daughter,

I bele^ve it, Father.

But one scruple yet remains with me.
Which doth very much trouble me.

You deserve to be shent with your (...),
You seek a knot in a bull-rush.

What is that?

Her name
Doth not accord.

Sh^e had another name truly when she was a little girl.

What, Crito? Do you remember it.

I am calling it to mind.

Should I suffer this mans memory to hinder my pleasure,
Seeing I can easily help my self in this matter?
I will not suffer it. O Chremes, the name is Pasibula which you enquire after.

That is she.

That is just she.

I heard it of her a thousand times.

Chremes, I think you believe that we are all glad at this.

In g^ earnest; I believe it.

Father, what remains more to be done?

The matter it self hath reconciled me towards you a good while ago.

O fine father! Chremes alters nothing about my wife,
But that I may have her so as I have had.

Very good reason, except your father
Say otherwise.

As for the portion forsooth.

That indeed is to be looked after.

Her portion.
is five hundred pounds.

I accept it.

I haste to my daughter.
(...) Crito, go along with me, for I believe she scarce knows me.

Why do you not give order she should be brought over hither?

You do well to put us in mind, I will now Commit that business to Davus.

He cannot do it.

Why can he not?

Because he hath another thing which more concerns him, and a greater matter
then that.

What is it?

He is fast in Prison.

Father, he is wrongfully imprisoned.

Not so, I commanded it.

I pray you bid him be set at liberty.

Well, be it so.

But make h^ste.

I am going in.

O what a joyful and happy day is this!

MI^te orare* una harum quaevis causa me, ut faciam, monet.
Vel tu, vel quod verum est, vel quod ipsi cup^o Glycerio.

Andrium ego Critonem video? certe is est.

Salvus sis, Chreme.

Quid tu Athenas insolens?

Even it. Sed hiccine est Simo?



Men' quaeris? Eho, tu Glycerium hinc civem ais esse?

Tu negas?

Itane huc paratus advenis?

Quare?

Rogas?
Tune impune haec facias? tune hic homines adolescentulos
Imperitos rerum, eductos libere, in fraudem illicis?
Sollicitando pollicitando eorum animos lactas?



Ac meretricios amores nuptiis conglutinas?

Perii; metuo, ut substet hospes.

Si, Simo, hunc noris satis,
Non ita arbitrere. Bonus est hic vir.

Hic vi^ sit bonus?
Itane adtemperate evenit body in ipsis nuptiis,
Ut veniret antehac nunquam? est vero huic credendum, Chremes?



Sycophan^a.

Hem!

Sic Crito est hic; mitte.

Videat
Qui siet. Si mihi pergat quae vult dicere, ea quae non vult audiet.
Ego istaec moveo aut curo? non tu tuum malum aequo animo feres?
Nam ego quae dixi, vera an fal^a audieris, jam sciri potest.

Et istaec una parva virgo; tum ille egens forte applicat
Primum ad Chrysidis patrem se.

Fabulam inceptar.

Sine.

Itane vero obturbat?

Perge.

Tum is mihi
Cognatus fuit, qui eum recepit. Ibi ego audivi ex illo sese


Ejus nomen?

Nomen.
Tam cito tibi? Phania.

Hem, perii.

Verum hercle
Opinor fuisse Phaniam. Hoc certo scio, Ramnusium se aiebat esse.

O Jupiter!

Eadem haec, O Chreme, multi alii in Andro
Tum audivere.

Utinam id sit quod spero. Eho, dic mihi
Quid eam tum? Suamne esse aiebat.

Non.

Cujam igitur?

Fratris filiam.

Certe mea est.

Quid ais?

Quid
T^s?

Arrige aures* Pam^hile.

Qui credis?

Phania ille frater meus fait.

Noram scio.

Is hinc bellum fugiens, meque in Asiam pe^sequens

Post illa, nunc primum audio quid illo fit factum.

V x sum ap^, ita animus commotus est metu,
Spe, gaudio, mirando hoc tanto, tam repentino bono.

Sane istam multis modis, tuam inveniri gaudeo.



At mihi unus scrupulus etiam restar
Qui me male habet.

Dignus es cum tua religione odio;
Nodum in sc^rpo quaeris.

Quid istuc est.

Nomen
Non convenit.

Fuit hercle huic aliud parvae.

Quid, Crito? Nunquid meministi?

Id quaero.


Cum ego possim in h^c re medicari mihi?
Non patia* Heus Chreme, quod quaeris Pasibula est.

Ipsa est.

E^ est.

Ex ipsa millies aud^vi.

Onnes nos ga^dere hoc, Chreme, te credo credere.



Quid restat, parer?

(...) (...) res reduxit me ipsa in gratiam.

O ^ de ux^re, (...) p^ssedi, nihil
Mutat Chremes.

Causa o^ tima est, nisi quid pater
Aliud ait.

Nempe.

Id scilicet.

Do^


Acc^p^o.

Propero ad filiam.
Eho, Crito mecum, nam illam me credo haud nosse.

Cur non
Illam huc transferri jubes?

Recte admones, Davo ego
Istuc dedam jam negotii.

Non potest.

Qui non potest?

Quia habet aliud magis ex sese, majus.

Quidnam?



Peter, non recte vinctus est.

Haud ita, jussi.

Jube solvi, obsecro.

Age, fiat.

At matura.

Eo intro.

O faustum felicem hunc diem!

I Am going to see what Pamphilus doth, and lo where he is.

Some body perhaps
May-think I do not believe this to be true; but I have a good mind that it be
thus true.
I suppose the life of the Gods is therefore everlasting,
Because pleasures do properly belong to them, for I am immortal
Already, if no grief at all intermingle with this joy.
What, whom should I chiefly desire now to be offered me, to whom I may tell
these things?

What joy is that?

I see Davus: There is no man that I had rather have
Of all men living. For I know that he alone will be hearti'y glad of any thing
that rejoices me.

PRoviso quid agate Pamphilus, at{que} eccum!

Aliquis forsitan
Me putet non putare hoc verum: at mihi nunc sic esse hoc verum lubet.
Ego vitam Deorum propterea sempiternam esse arbitror,
Quod voluptates eorum propriae sunt; nam mihi immortalitas

Sed quem ego potissimum mihi exoptem nunc, cui haec narrem, dari?

Quid illud gaudii est?

Davum video: nemo est, quem mallem
Omnium. Nam hunc scio mea solide solum gavisurum gaudia.

WHere is this Pamphilus?

Davus!

What man is that, that calls me?

It is 1.

O Pamphilus!

You do not know what hath befallen me.

True indeed: But I know what hath befallen my self.

And so do I too.

The fashion of the world goes, that you should first know what harm I have
got,
5. Then I know what good hath befallen you.

My Glycerie hath found
Her Father and Mother.

That is well.

What now?

Her Father is
An especial friend of ours.

Who is that?

Chremes.

You say well.

and there is no delay, but I must marry her.

Doth he dream
On those things which his mind ran upon when he was awake?

And as for the child, Davus.

Tush, say no more.
He is the only child whom the Gods love.

I am well, if these things be true;
I will go to him, and speak with him.

What man is this? O Charinus, you come
In the very nick of time.

It is well done.

What, have you heard the matter?

I have heard all; well, think of me in your prosperity. Now Chremes is yours,
I know he will do all things that you would have him do.

I know it:
But it would be too long for us to tarry for him till he come forth; follow me
this way.
He is within with Glycerie. Do you Davus go quickly home,
Fetch some body to lead her away hence: why do you stand still? why do you
loiter?

I am going.
Do not ye tarry till they come out hither; she will be married within:
It will be dispatched within doors, if there be any thing remaining to be
done. Clap your hands.

Pamphilus ubinam hic est?

Dave.

Quis homo est qui me?

Ego sum.

O Pamphile.

Nescis quid mihi obtigerit.

Certe, sed quid mihi obtigerit, scio.

Et quidem ego.

More
Hominum evenit, ut quid sim nactus mali, prius rescisceres tu,


Mea Glycerium la
Parents repperit.

O factum been.

Hem!

Pater amicus
Summus nobis.

Quis?

Chremes.

Narras probe.

Nec
Mora ulla est, quin eam uxorem ducam.

Number ille somniat ea quae
Vigilans voluit?

Tum de puero, Dave.

Ah, desine,


Salvus sum, si haec vera sunt.
Adibo colloquar.

Quis homo est? O Charine, in tempore
Ipso mihi advenis.

Been factum.

Hem, audistin?

Omnia: age, me in tuis secundis rebus respice: Tuus est nunc Chremes:
Facturum quae voles scio esse omnia.

Memini, at{que} adeo

Intus apud Glycerium est. Tu, Dave, abi domum propere,
Accerse, hinc qui auferant eam: quid stas? quid cessas?

Eo,
No expectetis, dum exeant huc; intus despondebitur;
Intns transigetur, si quid est quod restat. Plaudit.
