Publii Terentii Carthageniensis Afri

Acta Ludis Funebribus Lucii Aemilii Pauli;

Q. Fabio Maximo, P. Cornelio Africano Aedilibus Curulibus.

Quos fecere L. Attilius Praenestinus Minutius Prothimus.

Modos fecit Flaccus Claudii Tibiis Sarranis.

Graeca est Menandri; Edita L. Anicio (Gallo) Marco Cornelio (Cethego)
Consulibus.

Anno Ab Urbe condita D XC V. Ante Christum na^um C LX VIII.

A Comedy of Publius Terentius an African of Carthage.

Acted At the Funeral solemnities of Lucius Aemilius Paulus;

Q. Fabius Maximus and Publius Cornelius Africanus Being Aediles Curules.

Which Lucius Praenestinus and Minutius Prothimus set out.

Flaceus the Son of Claudius tuned it On Pipes that had even holes, such as the
Sarrans or Tyrians used.

It is a Greek Comedy of Menanders, published When Lucius Anicius (Gallus) and
Marcus Cornelius (^ethegus) were Consuls.

In the Year Since the city Rome was built DXCV. Before Christ was born C LX
VIII.

WHere as Demea had two young men to his sons,
He gives Aeschines to his brother Mitio to be adopted,
But keeps Ctesipho with himself. This Ctesipho
Being caught with the pleasant deportment of a minstrelless,

His brother Ae^chinus concealed, and took upon him too
The report of his love, and at last
He took the m^nstre less from the bawd by force. This same Aeschinus
Had deflowered a poor girl a citizen of Athens;

After the truth was discovered, Aeschinus married
The maid the citizen of Athens, that he had deflowered;
Ctesipho enjoys the minstrelless as his wife,
His harsh father D^mea being over-intreated with much ado.
DUos cum haberet Demea adolescentulos,
Dat Mitioni fratri adoptandum Aeschinum,
Sed Ctesiphonem retinet. H^haristriae
Lepore captum, sub doro ac t^i^ti patre,

Amoris in se transferebat, benique
Fidicinam lenoni eripuit. Vitiaverat
Idem Aeschinus civem At^icam pauperculam;
Fidenque dederat, hanc sibi uxo^em fore.

Ut veritas patefacta est, ducit Aes^hinus
A se vitiatam civem Atticam virginem;
Uxore potitur Ctesipho citharistria,
Exo ato suo patre duro Demea.
Forasmuch as the Poet perceived his Comedy, which we are to act,
To be pried into by carping men, and that his adversaries
Wrest all to the worse sense:
He will lay open himself, and you shall be the judges,

Synapothnescontes is a Comedy of Diphilus's,
Plautus made it a Comedy called Commorientes;
In the Greek Comedy there is a young-man that took forsibly
A whore from a bawd; in the first part of the Comedy, Plautus
Terence hath taken it to himself
Into his Adelphi, and hath translated it word by word.
We are to act it as a new one. Consider well,
Whether you think there is a theft committed, or a place
Taken in, which was omitted by Plautus's negligence;

Do help him, and write together with him day by day;
What they think to be a mighty disgrace,
He takes it to be a very great commendation, forasmuch as he likes them
Who give content to you all in general, and the people also,

Every one used, as his occasions were, without disdain.
Furthermore, do not expect (I should tell you) the plot of the Comedy.
The two old men that will come first, will discover part,
Others will show apart in the acting. See, that your indifferency
May add to the Poet's industry for writing.
POstquam Poeta sensit scripturam suam
Ab iniquis observari, adversarios
Rapere in pejorem partem, quam acturi sumus:
Indicio de se ipse erit, vos eritis judices,

Synapothneseontes Diphili comoedia est,
Eam Commorientes Plautus fecit fabulam:
In Graeca adolescens est, qui lenoni eripuit
Mere^icem; in prima fabula, eum Plautus locum

In Adelphos, verbum de verbo expressum extulit.
Eam nos acturi sumus novam; Pernoscite,
Furtu^ne factum existumetis, an locum
Reprehensum, qui praeteritus negligentia est.

Eum adjutare, assidueque una scriber:
Quod illi maledictum vehemens esse existimant,
Eam laudem hic ducit maxumam, cum illis placet,
Qui vobis universis, populo placent;

Suo quisque tempore usus est sine superbia.
Dehinc no expectetis argumentum fabulae;
Senes qui primi venient duo, partem aperient,
In agendo partem ostendent. Facite, aequanimitas

STorax! Aeschinus is not come back again this night from supper,
Nor any one of my servants which went to meet him?
Indeed this is true that folks say if one be absent any where,
Of if one linger anywhere, it were better that those things should fall out,

Being angry, then those things which tender parents conceit
If you linger your w^fe thinks either that you love some body else,
Or t^t y^u are beloved of some body, or that you are tippling, or taking your
pleas^re,
And that you alone are in a good condition, when she is in an evil case.

With what things am I now troubled? fear be should be starved,
Or fallen somewhere, or have broken some joins of him.
Ah, that any man should propose in his mind, no
Provide what m^y be dearer then he is to himself!

Of another dispositi^n: now ever since I was a youth,
I h^ve followed this quiet citizen's life, and my own ease,
And ^hat which they account to be a happy thing,
I never had a wife; he is as far on the other side, be follows all these,

Sparingly and hardly; he hath married a wife, he hath two sons
Born him; thereupon I adopted this elder son to my self.
I have brought him up of a little one, I have esteemed, and loved him as my
own;
I take pleasure in him, that thing is my only darling.

I give him (what he would have) I leave him to his liberty, I think it not
necessary
To do all things as I may my self. Lastly, what others do,
Unknown to their fathers, which youth prompteth,
I have used my son, not to conceal them from me.

Dare to do it, will so much the more dare to do it to others.
I think it better to keep in children
With bash fulness and freedom, then with fear.
In these things my brother and I do not agree, nor do they please him.
Mitio?
Why do you spoil us the young man? why is he in love?
Why doth he tipple? why do you allow him expenses in these things?
You let him go too brave; you are too fond and foolish.
He himself is too rigorous beyond all right and reason:

Who thinks a government to be more settled and firm
Which is maintained by force, then that which is gotten by good will.
This is my opinion, and thus I am persuaded in my mind;
He that doth his duty being constrained through smart,

If he hope it may be carried closely he returns to his old bias again.
He whom you gain by a courtesy, doth what he doth heartily,
He studies to requite you; he will be all one, be he present or absent.
This is a fatherly part, rather to accustom a son

Herein doth a father and a master differ. He that cannot do this,
Let him confess he knows not how to command children.
But is not this be himself of whom I was speaking? yea verily it is he.
I know not why I see him so sad; I believe he will chide even now,
Demea, I am glad you are come in safety hither.

STorax! non rediit haec nocte a caena Ae^chinus,
Neque servulorum quisquam qui adversum ierant?
Profecto hoc vere di^unt: si absis uspiam,
Aut ubi si cesses, evenire ea satius est,

Irata, quam illa quae parents propitii.
Uxor, si cesses, aut te amare cogitat,
Aut tete amari, aut potare, aut animo obsequi,
Et tibi been esse soli, cum sibi sit male.

Quibus nunc solicitor rebus? no aut ille alserit,
Aut uspiam ceciderit, aut perfregerit aliquid.
Vah, quemqua ^ne hominum in animum instituere, aut
Parare, quod sit carius quam ipse est sibi!

Dissimili studio est; jam inde ab adolescentia,
Ego hanc clementem vitam urbanam, atque otium
Secutus sum,, quod fortunatum isti putant,
Uxorem nunquam habui: ille contra, haec omnia,

Se habere; uxorem duxit, nati filii
Duo: inde ego hunc majorem adoptavi mihi:
Eduxi a parvulo, habui, amavi pro meo;
In eome oblecto: solum id est carum mihi.

Do, permitto; non necesse habeo omnia
Pro meo jure agere: postremo, alii clanculum
Patres quae faciunt, quae fert adolescentia,
Ea no me celet, assuefeci filium.

Audebit, tanto magis audebit caeteros.
Pudore, liberalitate liberos
Retinere satius esse credo, quam metu.
Haec fratri mecum non conveniunt, neque placent.
Mitio?
Cur perdis adolescentem nobis? cur amat?
Cur potat? cur tu his rebus sumptum suggeris?
Vestitu nimio indulges; nimium ineptus es.
Nimium ipse est durus, praeter aequui bonum:

Qui imperium credat gravius esse aut stabilius,
Vi quod fit, quam illud quod amici^ia adjungitur.
Mea sic est ratio, sic animum induco meum,
Malo coactus qui suum officium facit,

Si sperat fore clam, rursum ad ingenium redit.
Ille quem beneficio adjungas, ex animo facit;
Studet par refer, praesens absensque idem erit.
Hoc patrium est, potius consuefacere filium,

Hoc pater ac dominus interest. Hoc qui nequit,
Fateatur nescire imperare liberis.
Sed estne hic ipsus de quo agebam? certe is est.
Nescio quid tristem video; credo jam, ut solet,


OH ^in very good time: it is even you that I looked for.

Why are you so sad?

Do you ask me, and know where Aeschinus is, why I am so sad?
Did not I tell you this would come to pass?

What hath he done?

What hath he done?
Who is not ashamed of any thing, nor fears any man; nor thinks he himself

Heretofore; what aetrick hath he played but lately?

What is that?

He hath broken open the doors, and hath rushed violently in
Into another mans house: he hath beaten the good man himself
And all his family, and almost killed them; he hath forcibly taken away

Done: how many folks, Mitio, have told me this as I was coming to you!
It is in all peoples mouths; and to be short,
If an example be to be compared with him, he doth not see his brother
To be busied about husbandry, to be thrifty teperate in the country;
Mitio,
I tell you, you suffer him to be spoiled.

Never was there any thing more unreasonable then an ignorant fellow,
Who thinks nothing to be right, but what he doth himself.

To what purpose is this?

Because you, Demea, judge amiss of this matter:

To haunt whores, nor to fuddle, it is no fault, nor to break open
Doors: if neither I nor you did these things,
Want of means did not suffer us to do them. Now you account that
For your commendation, which you did then through want.

We should have done it: and if you were a wise man, you would suffer
That son of yours to do it now, whilst age will give him leave,
Rather then, when he hath buried you, whose death he hath long expected,
To do these things afterwards for all that in a more unfitting age.


Is it not a heinous matter for a young man to do these things?

Pish,
Hear me. Do not trouble my head about this thing too often.
You gave me your Son to be adopted;
He is now become mine: if he do amiss, Demea, in any thing,

He feasts, he fudleth, he smells of perfumes at my charges.
Doth he love? I will allow him money, when I think it sitting;
When I think it not fitting, perhaps he shall be packed out of doors.
Hath he broken any doors? they shall be repaired, hath he rent any clothes?
they shall be mended.

Lastly, either give over, or appoint whom you will to be judge betwixt us.
I will make it appear that you offend more in this matter then I.

W^ is me.
Learn to be a father of them, who know indeed, what it is to be one.

You are his father by nature, and I by my advising him.



Pish, if you hold on, I will ^be gone.

Do you serve me so?

Should I hear you so often about the same matter?

I have a care over him.

And I have a care over him. But, Demea,
Let us both care an equal share. Do you care for the one,
And I also for the other. For for you to take care of both, is in a manner


Ah. Mitio.

I think so.

Why am I against it? If that content you,
Let him lavish it, let him waste it, let him come to nought. It is nothing at
all to me.
Now if I speak any one word hereafter.

Are you angry again,
Demea?

Do not you believe it? Do I demand again whom I have given?

You would have me look to one; I do look to him, and I thank God.
Forasmuch as he is so, as I would have him to be, that your son shall feel
Hereafter himself. I will say no worse against him.

Something, but not-all is true that he saith; nevertheless

That I am grieved at it; for he is such a man,
When I pacify him, I am all I can against him, and terrify him from his
purpose:
Yet he scarcely takes it as a man ought to do; but if I should increase
Or else help forward his angry fit,
Aeschinus
Doth us some wrong in this business.
What whore is there that he hath not been in love with, or on whom hath he not
bestowed
Something or other? At the last now of late (I think he was now grown weary
Of them all) he saith he hath a mind to marry a wife.

I was glad of it. And l^e his resolution of a fresh; but what ever it is,
I will know, and meet with the fellow, if he be in the market.

EHem, oppor un: teipsum quaerito.

Q^id tristis es?

Rogit ^me, ubi no^is Aeschinus siet, quid tristis go ^m?
Dixin' hoc sore?

Quid fecit?

Quid ille secerit?
Quem neque pudet quiequam, nec metuit quemquam, neque legem putat

O^ i^o; modo quid distignavit?

Quidnam id est?

Fores effregit, atque in aedes irruit
Alienas; ipsum dominum atque omnem familiam
Multavit usque ad mortem: cripuit mulierem,

Factum esse: hoc advenienti quot mihi, Mitie,
Direre; in ore est omni populo; denique,
Si conferendum exemplum est, non fratrem videt
Rei dare operam, ruri esse parcum ac sobrium?
Mitio,
Dico, tibi dico, tu illum corrumpi sinis.

Homine imperito nunquam quicquam inj^stius est;
Qui, nisi quod ipse facit, nihil rectum putat.

Quorsum istuc?

Quia tu, Demea, hoc male judicas;

Scortari, neque potare, non est, neque fores
Effringere: haec si neque ego, neque tu fe^imus,
Non sivit egestas facere nos. Tu nunc tibi
Id laudi ducis, quod tunc secisti inopia.

Faceremus: tu illum tuum, si esses homo,
Sineres nunc facere, dum per aetatem licet,
Potius quam ubi te expectatum ejecisset f^r^s,
Alienore aetate post facere tamen.


Non est flagitium facere haec adolescentulum?

Ah,
Ausculta. No me obtundas de hac re saepius.
Tuum filium dedisti ad^ptandum mihi;
Is meus est factus; si quid peccat, Demea,

Obsonat, potat, olet unguenta de meo.
Amat? dabi^u a me argentum, dum erit commodum;
Ubi non erit, fortasse excludetur for as.
Fores eff^g^? restituentur. discidit vestem? resarcictur.

Poste^o, aut desine, aut cedo quemvis arbit^um:
Te plura in hac re peceare ostendam.

Hei mihi!
Pater esse disc ab illis, qui vere s^iunt.

Natura to illi pater es, consiliis ego.



Ah, si pergis, abiero.

Siccine agis?

An ego te toties de eadem re audiam?

Curae est mihi.

Et mihi curae est; verum, Demea,
Curemus aequam uterque partem: an alterum,
Ego item alterum: nam ambos curare, propemodum


Ah. Mitio.

Mihi sic videtur.

Quid istuc* Si tibi istuc places,
Persundat, perdat, pereat, nihil ad me attinet.
Jam si verbum ullum posthac.

Rursum, Demea,
Irascere?

An non credis? repeton' quem dedi?

Unum vis curem; curo; est Diis gratia,
Cum ita ut volo, est, iste tuus ipse sentiet
Posterius: molo in illum (...) vius dicere.

Nec nihil, neque omnia haec sunt, quae dicit, tamen

Me aegre pati illi nolui; nam ita est homo;
Cum placo, adversor sedulo deterreo,
Tamen vix humane patitur: verum si augeam,
Aut etiam adjutor sim ejus iracundiae,

Nonnullam in hac^re nobis facit injuriam.
Quam hic non amavit meretriem, aut cui non dedit
Aliquid? Postremo nuper (credo jam omnium
Taedebat) dicit velle uxorem ducere.

Gaudebam. Ecce autem de integro; nisi quidquid est,
Volo scire, at{que} hominem convenire, si apud forum est.

I Beseech you, neighbours, help a poor innocent man, Succour one that needs
help.

Leisurely, stand now here without any more ado.
Why do you look back? There is no danger. This fellow shall never meddle with
you,
Whilst I am here.

I will keep her in despite of all your teeth.



Aeschinus hear me, that you may not say you was ignorant of my condition of
life.
I am a bawd.

I know it.

But such a one, as any one of the best credit hath been in any place.
That you should excuse your self hereafter, that you were loath this wrong
should have been done
To me, I will not value it thus much. Believe me this, I will defend my own
right;

I know these words of yours, you were loath it should have been done. Oath will
be given, that you do not deserve
To have this wrong offered you, where as I my self am unworthily dealt
withal.

Go valerously on, and open the door.

But, you had as good do nothing herein.

Go you your ways in even now.

But I will not suffer him.

Come hither, Parmeno;

Have a care, you do not turn your eyes any whither from mine, that there be no
stay, if
I wink to you, but your fist may be presently about his ears.

I would have him
To try that.

Oh, save her. Let the woman go.

O wretched
Act!

He shall give you as much more, unless you take heed.

Oh the wretchedness!

I had not winked to you


What a thing is this?
Aeschinus, have you the Kingly command here?

If I had, you should be rewarded
According to your deserts.

What have you to do with me?

Nothing.

What?
Do you know who I am?

I do not desire.

Have I meddled with any thing of yours?

If you had meddled with any thing,
You should have smarted for it.

How comes it to be more lawful for you to have mine, for whom*


It would have been better for you not to have railed
On me before the door. For if you go on to trouble me, you shall presently be
haled in,
And be there scourged with whip-thongs to death.

A free-man with whip-thongs?

It shall be so.

O wicked fellow! Do men say that here is like freedom to all men?

If you have brawled enough, bawd, hear me now if you be disposed.

And I, have I brawled?


Let those things pass, return to the point*

What thing?
Whither should I return?

Would you have me now tell you what may concern you?

I desire it, so it be any thing honest.

Whoo, the bawd would not have me speak dishonest things.

I am a bawd, I confess, a common destruction of young-men, a perfidious
fellow, a plague;
Yet I have done you no wrong.

For that truly remains yet to be done.

Aeschinus, go back thither, where you begun.

You bought her,
For twenty pounds, (which thing may it never thrive with thee) so much money
shall be paid you.

What if I will not sell her? will you force me?

No.

For I was afraid of that.

For I think she should not be offered to be sold who is a free-woman;
For I by laying on my hand restore her to her liberty up^n an action of
freedom. Now choose you,

Till I return again.

O mighty Iupiter! I do not wonder at them that begin.
To run mad after they have done wrong. He hath pulled me out of my house, he
hath beaten me,
He hath taken away my woman, whether I will or no; for these ill turns he
requires
I should deliver her for so much as I bought her. Oh, he hath given me poor
man above 500

What is his own by right. Well, now I desire it were done, if so be he would
but pay my money.
But I guess this, when I shall say I will give him her for so much, he will
presently take witness,
That I have sold her; I do but dream of my money, by and by, come again
tomorrow. I can
Endure that, if he will but pay it: though it be a wrongful business; but I
consider,

Of young men. But no body will give it me; in vain
Do I cast up these accounts with my self.

OBsecro, populares, ferte misero atque innocenti auxilium, Subvenite inopi.

Otiose, illico jam nunc hic consiste.
Quid respectas? nihil pericli est. Nunquam, dum ego
Adero, hic te tanget.

Ego istam invitis omnibus.



Aeschine aud^, no te ignarum fuisse dicas meorum morum,
Leno ego sum.

Scio.

At ita, ut usquam fuit fide quisquam optuma.
Tu quod te posterius purges, hanc injuriam mihi nolle
Factum esse, hujus non faciam. cred hoc, ego meum jus pros^ quar;

Novi ego vestra haec, nolle factum; jusjurandum dabitur, te esse
Indignum injuria hac: indignis cum ego met sim acceptus modis.

Abi praestrenue, ac sores aperi.

Caeterum, hoc nihil facis.

I intro jam nunc tu.

At enim, non sinam,

Accede huc, Parmeno;

Cave nunc jam oculos a meis quoquam dimoveas tuos, no mora sit, si
Innuero, quin pugnus continuo in mala haereat.

Istuc volo
Ego ipsum experiri.

Hem serva, omit mulierem.

O miserum
Facinus!

Geminabit, nisi caves.

Hei miseriam!

Non innueram,


Quid hoc rei est?
Regnumne Aeschine, hic tu possides?

Si possiderem, ornatus esses
Ex tuis virtutibus.

Quid tibi rei mecum est?

Nihil.

Quid?
Nostin' quis sim?

Non desidero.

Tetigin' tui quicquam?

Si attigisses,
Ferres infortunium.

Qui tibi magis licet meam habere, pro qua ego


Ante aedes non fecisse erit
Melius hoc convitium. Nam si molestus perges esse, jam intro abripiere;
Atque ibi us{que} ad necem operiere loris.

Loris liber!

Sic erit.

O hominem impurum! hiccine libertatem aiunt esse aequam omnibus?

Si satis debacchatus es, leno, audi, si vis, nunc jam.

Egone debacchatus


Mitte ista, at{que} ad rem redi.

Quam rem?
Quo redeam?

Jamne me vis dicere quod ad te attinet?

Cupio, modo aequi aliquid.

Vah, leno iniqua me non vult loqui.

Leno sum, fateor, pernicies communis adolescentium, perjurus, pestis:
Tamen tibi a me nulla est orta injuria.

Nam herele etiam id restat.



Minis viginti tu illam
Emisti (quae res tibi male vertat) argenti, tantum dabitur.

Quid si ego tibi illam nolo vendere? cogesne?

Mi^ime.

Namque id ^tui.

Neque venundandam ceuseo, quae libera est:
Nam ego liberali illam assero causa manu. Nunc vide utrum vis
Argentum accipere, an causam meditari tuam, Delibera hoc, dum ego
Redeo, leno.

Proh sum Jupiter! minim mirer, qui infanite
Oc^ipiunt ex injuria. Domo me eripuit, verberavit; me invito
Abduxit meam. Ob malefacta haec tantidem emptam postulat sibi
Tradier. O, la misero plus quingentos colaphos

Jas postulat. Age, jam cupio, si modo argentum reddat. Sed ego
Hoc atiolor, ubi me dixero dare tanti, testes faciat illico
Vendidisse me. De la somnium, mox, cras redi. Id quoque
Possum far, si modo reddat: quanquam injurium est; verum cogito
Id quod res est, quando eum quaestum incepetis, accipienda
Mussitanda injuria adolescentium est. Sed nemo dabit; frustra
Ego mecum has rationes deputo.

HOld your peace, I my self will go meet with him, I will make him new glad to
take it.
And that he said he is well dealt withal. What is that Sannio, that I hear
you
Quarrelled with my master, I know not what about?

I never saw a quarrel
More unjustly carried, then this which was to day betwixt us. I with bearing
blows,


Through your own fault.

What
Should I do?

You should have humoured the young-man.

How could I do it
Better, who have continually suffered him to beat me?

Come on, do you know what I would say?
To set light by money when occasion serves is sometimes the greatest gain.
Whoo, you were afraid,
If you had now yielded from your right a little, and had conformed yo^r self
to the young-man,


I do not buy hope with ready money.

You will never grow rich.
Go your way, you know not how to bring men to your lure, Syrus.

I believe that were
Better; but I was never so crafty; but rather whatever I could,
I had rather take it for the present.

Go too, I know your mind,

And besides they say that you are going to Cyprus.

Tush.

And you have bought
Many things, which you are to carry hence thither, and that a ship is hired:
I know this,
You are in a doubt what to do; I hope when you return thence, for all this
you will mind this business.

I will not st^r a foot any whither: I am undone; he hath begu^ this upon this
hope.

He is afraid
I have made the fellow he cannot tell what to do. O roguery! mark this.
He hath come upon me in the very instant. I have bought many women, and other
things
Which I am to transport hence into Cyprus: except I come thither to the mart,
I shall lose very much.
If I omit this now, I shall do up good in my suit, when I return thence, there
is nothing to be had.
The suit is grown cold, now you come at last; why did you suffer it? where was
you?

Then.

Have you now cast up what you think will be coming to you?

Is this a thing fitting for him to do? that Aeschinus should offer to do
this, to desire
By force to take her from me?

He begins to quail. I have but this one thing to say.
Consider it, if you like well; divide the whole, rather then come into danger,
Sannio whether you shall save or lose all, He will make hard shift to get ten
pounds
Somewhere or other.

Woe is me, now I poor man come to doubt of the principal.
He is ashamed of nothing, he hath made all my teeth loose, besides all my head
is soft
As a fuz-ball with his boxes, and would he defraud me too? I am going no
whither hence.

Do as you please; will you have any thing else? for I must be gone.

Yes indeed; this
Syrus, however these things have been done, yet rather then I will follow
suites,
Let me have my own paid me, or at least as much as she cost me. Syrus, I know
you never
Made use of my friendship heretofore; you shall say I am both mindful and
thankful.

I will do the best I can: but I see Ctesipho, he is glad for his sweet-heart

What is it that I entreat you to do?

Stay a little while.

TAce, egomet conveniam ipsum, ut cupide accipiat jam f^xo.
Been dicat secum actum. Quid istuc, Sannio, quod te audio
Nescio quid concertasse cum hero?

Nunquam vidi iniqu^us
Certationem comparatam, quam haec quae body inter nos fuit. Ego vapulando,


Tua culpa.

Quid
Agerem?

Adolescenti morem gestum oportuit.

Qui potui
Melius, qui body usque os praebui?

Age, scis quid loquar?
Pecuniam in loco negligere, maximum interdum est lucrum. Hui, metuisti,
Si nunc de tuo jure contulisses paululum, atque adolescenti

Istuc foeneraret.

Ego spe pretio non emo.

Nunqua re facies,
Abi, nescis inescare homines, Sannio.

Credo istuc melius
Esse; verum ego nunqua adeo astutus fui; quin quicquid possem,
Mallem auserrem potius in praesentia.

Age, novi tuum

Praeterea autem te aiunt proficisci Cyprum.

Hem.

Coemisse
Hinc quae illuc veheres multa, navem conductam; hoc scio,
Animus tibi pendet; ubi illinc, spero, redieris, tamen hoc ages.

Nusquam pedem; perii hercle, hac ille spe hoc incepit.

Timet.
Injeci scrupulum la.

O scelera! illuc vide in ipso
Articulo oppressit, emptae mulieres complures, item hinc alia,
Quae porto Cyprum; nisi eo ad mercatum venio, damnum maximum est.
Nunc si hoc omittam, actum agam ubi illine rediero; nihil est,
Refrixerit res, nunc demum venis: cur passus? ubi eras?

Persequi.

Jamne enumerasti id quod ad te rediturum putas?

Hoccine illo dignum est? hoccine incipere Aeschinnm, per oppressionem
Ut hanc mihi eripere postulet?

Labascit. Unum hoc habeo,
Vide si satis placet; dividuum face, potius quam venias in periculum,
Sannio, servesne an perdas ^otum. Minus december conradet
Alicunde.

Hei mihi, etiam de forte nunc verio in dubium miser.
Pudet nihil, omnes dentes labefecit mihi: praeterea colaphis
Tuber est totum caput; etiam insuper defraudet? nusquam abeo.

Ut lubet; nunquid vis, quin abeam?

Imo hercle hoc
Sire, ut ut haec sunt facta, potius quam lites sequar,
Meum reddatur, saltem quanti empta est, Sire. Scio te non esse usum
Antehac amicitia mea; memorem me dices esse, g^at^.

Sedulo faciam: sed Ctesiphonem video, laetus est de amica.

Quid, quod te oro?

Paulisper mane.

ONe would be glad to receive a courtesy from any man, when need is,
But indeed that courtesy only brings delight, if he do it, to whom it
belongs of right to do it.
O brother, brother, how should I now commend you? I know very will I can never
speak
Any thing so high, but your desert goes beyond it: and therefore I think, I
have this one

That is more excellent in the chiefest feats.

O Ctesipho.

O Syrus, where is Aeschinus?

Lo where he is there, he tarrieth for you
At home.

Oh!

What is the matter?

What it should be? By his means, Syrus,
I am now alive.

O merry man!

Who thought all his own concernments

The being in Love, and the offence hath he taken upon himself.

He can do no more.

But who is that? the door creeks.

Tarry, tarry, he himself comes forth.

ABs quivis homine, cum est opus, beneficium accipere gaudeas.
Verum enimvero id demum juvat, si quem aequum est facere, is been facit.
O frater, frater, quid ego nunc te laudem? satis certe scio, nunquam ita
magnifice
Quicquam dicam, id virtus quin superet tua; itaque unam hanc rem

Nemini esse primarum artium magis principem.

O Ctesipho. O Sire, Aeschinus ubi est?

Ellum, te expectat
Domi.

Hem.

Quid est?

Quid sit? illius opera, Sire,
Nunc vivo.

Festivum caput!

Qui omnia sibi post putarit esse prae meo


Nihil supra potest.

Sed quisnam! fores crepuit.

Mane, Mane,
Ipse exit for as.

WHere is that rogue?

Doth he seek for me? Doth he bring out any thing! I am undone,
I see nothing.

O he very well: I am seeking for you; what is done, Ctesipho?
All is cock-sure, and therefore leave your sadness.

I indeed do easily
Let it pass, who have you to be my brother, Aeschinus, O mine own brother!

Rather to flatter you, then that I account it a kindness.

Go to you fool,
As though we were not acquainted betwixt our selves, O Ctesipho; but this
grieves me,
That we had known it almost too late, and that it was come to that pass, that
if all men should desire,
They could not help you.

I was ashamed

Alas, that is folly,

I pray God forbid these things.

I have done amiss.

What saith Sannio to us
Now at last?

He is now tame.

I will go to the market, that I way
Dispatch this fellow; do you go in to her, C^pho.

Syrus, put him on.

Let us go.
For he is hasting into Cyprus.

Not so fast indeed: although I tarry also


It will be paid you, do not fear.

But speak that he may pay me all.

He will pay you all; do but hold your tongue and follow this way.

I will follow.

Ho,
Ho Syrus.

Anon, what is the matter?

I pray you heartily dispatch that very dishonest
Fellow, as soon as may be, lest if he be more provoked,
This may some way come to my fathers ear, and then I shall be undone for ever.


And command that tables be spread for us, and other things be got ready. I
will presently,
As soon as the business is done, come home with some meat.

Do so, I pray thee, and seeing
It hath fallen out well, let us have a merry day of this.

UBi ille sacrilegus?

Men' quaerit? number quidnam effert! occidi;
Nihil video.

Ehem, optume, teipsum quaerito; quid sit, Ctesipho?
In tuto est omnis res, omit vero tristitiam tuam.

Ego illam facile vere
Omitto, qui quidem re habeam fratrem, Aeschine, o mi germane!

Quam quod habeam gratum facere existumes.

Agc, inepte;
Quasi non noverimus nos inter nos, O Ctesipho; sed hoc mihi dolet,
Nos pene sero scisse, in eum locum rediisse, ut si omnes cuperent tibi,
Nihil possent auxiliarier.

Pudebat.

Ah, stultitia est istaec,

Deos quaeso, ut istaec prohibeant.

Peccavi.

Quid ait tandem
Nobis Sannio?

Jam mitis est.

Ego ibo ad sorum, ut hunc
Absolvam; tu intro ad eam Ctesipho:

Sire, insta.

Eamus.
Namque hic properat in Cyprum.

No tam quidem: quamvis etiam maneo


Reddetur, no time.

Ut omne reddat.

Omne reddet, tace modo ac la hac.

Sequar.

Heus,
Heus Sire.

Hem, quid est?

Obsecro hercle, hominem istum
Impurissimum quam primum absolvitote, no, si magis irritatus Siet, aliqua ad
patrem hoc permanent, atque ego tunc perpetuo peririm.


Et lectulos jube sterni nobis, parari caetera. Ego jam, transacta r^*
Convertam me ad domum cum obsonio.

Ita quaeso, quando.
Been successit, hilatem hunc sumamus diem.

I Pray you nurse, what shall be done now?

Do you ask, what shall be done?
Well truly, I hope.

Now, Nurse, her pangs begin of her first child bearing.

Now you fear, as though you were never by at a woman's labour, or never bare
child your self.

Woe is me poor woman, I have no body, we are all alone, and Geta is not here,


Truly he will be here by and by, for he never lets one day pass,
But he always comes.

He is the only remedy of my miseries.

As the case stands,
It could not be done better, then it is done, mistress: seeing a fault
Is committed, which principally pertains to him, such a one as he is, of such
a stock,


It is indeed so as you say,
I pray God, we may have him safe.

OBsecro, mea nutrix, quid nunc fiet?

Quid fiet, rogas?
R^cte aedipol, spero.

Modo dolores, mea tu, occipiunt primulum.

Jam nunc times, quasi nunquam adfueris, nunquam tute pepereris.

Miseram me, nemin^m habeo, solae sumus, Geta autem hic non adest:
Aeschinum.

Pol is quide jam hic aderit; nam nunq^ a unum intermittit die,
Quin semper veniat.

Solves mearum est miseriarum remedium.

E re nata,
Melius fieri haud potuit, quam factum est, hera; quando vitium
Oblatum est, quod ad illum attinet potissimum, talem, tali genere,


Ita pol est, ut dicis,
Salvus nobis, Deos quaeso, ut siet.

Now the matter is, that if all men should lay their heads together, and
Seek to remedy this evil, they could not afford any help,
Which evil hath befallen both me, and my mistress, and my wistrisses daughter.
Woe is me, poor wretch, so many things on a sudden
Beset me round about, from which there is no getting out; violence, poverty,

O wicked kind! O ungodlie fellow!

Wo is me poor woman,
What is the matter that I see Geta so fearful, and making such haste?

Whom neither promise,
Ner oath, nor any pity hath restrained, nor pulled back, nor
That her delivery was near, whom poor woman he had basely deflowered by force.



I pray you, Softrata,
Let us go nearer him.

A wretch that I am, I am scarce well in my wits,
I am so inflamed with auger. There is nothing that I more desire, then to meet
with
That whole family, that I may utter this anger upon them all, whilst this
grief
Is fresh, I should think I had punished them enough, if I were but revenged of
them.

And then Syrus the setter on; oh, what ways I would be revenged on him!
I would hoise him up on high by the middle, and first I would set him with his
heels upwards,
That he may sprinkle the way with his brains; I would ^ear out the eyes of the
young fellow himself, afterwards I would break his neck.
I would rush upon the rest, I would drive them before me, I would knock them,
I would throw them under my feet. but do I forbear,


Let us call him back. Geta.

How now!
Whosoever you are, let me alone.

It is I Sostrata.

Where is she?
I am seeking for you, I am looking for you, you came very fitly to meet me,
Mistress.

What is the matter, why do you quake?

Woe is me.

Why do you make so much haste
My Geta? take breath.

Utterly.

What means that utterly?

We are undone;


I pray you, what is it?

Now.

What
Now, Geta?

Aeschinus.

What hath he done then?

He is estranged from our family.

Alas, I am undone; wherefore?

He hath begun to love another.

Woe is me poor woman.

Neither did he it closely: he himself took her away from the bawd openly.

Is this certain enough?

It is certain, I saw it my self with these eyes, Sostrata.

Aeschinus,
The life of us all, in whom all our hope and wealth did consist,
Who swore that he would never live one day without her, who said
That he would lay the child on his fathers lap, and so beseech him
That he might marry her.

Mistress, forbear weeping,

Or tell it to any body?

Whisht, whisht, man, are you well in your wits?
Do you think this is to be told anywhere?

Truly, I do not like it,
First now the matter it self shows that his mind is estranged from us.
Now if we tell this abroad, I know very well, he will deny it:

Never so much, it is not good to give her him to wife, seeing he is in love
with another;
Wherefore it is necessary to concea'e it by any means.

Ah, I will in no wise do it.

What do you do?

I will tell it.

Ah Sostrata, consider what you do.

The matter cannot be in worse case then now it is; first, she hath no portion,

For a maid; this only remains, if he deny it, I have the ring with me for a
witness,
Which he lost. Lastly, seeing I am privy to my self, that I am far from this
fault,
And that there was neither hire nor any thing betwixt, unbeseeming her or me,
Geta,
I will try what can be done.

What is that? I come nearer that you may better tell me.

Go you,
Hegio all this matter in order;
For he was an especial friend to our Similus, and respected us very much.

For indeed
No body else regards us.

Make haste, my Canthara, run,
Fetch the mid-wife, that we may not stay of her, when need is.

NUnc illud est; quod si omnes omnia sua consilia conferant, atque
Huic malo salutem quaerant, auxilii nihil adferant,
Quod mihique, heraeque, filiaeque herili est: vae misero mihi! tot res repent
Circumvallant, unde emergi non potest; vis, egestas,

O genera sacrilega! O hominem impium!

Me miseram,
Quidnam est, quod sic video timidum properantem Getam?

Quem neque fides,
Neque jusjurandum, neque ulla misericordia repressit, neque reflexit, neque
Quod partus instabat proper; cui miserae indign vitium per vim obtulerat.



Propius, obsecro,
Accedamus, Sostrata.

Ah, me miserum! vix sum compose animi,
Ita ardeo iracundia. Nihil est, quod malim, quam totam illam familiam
Dari mihi obviam, ut iram hanc in eos evomam omnes, dum aegritudo est haec
Recens, satis mihi id habeam supplicii, dum illos ulciscar modo.

Tum autem Syrum impulsorem, vah, quibus illum ulciscar modis!
Sublimem medium arriperem, capite primum in terra statuerem,
Ut cerebro dispergat viam: adolescenti ipsi eriperem oculos, post haec
praecipitem darem:
Caeteros ruerem, agerem, raperem, tunderem, prosternerem; sed cesso


Revocemus Geta,

Hem,
Quisquis es, sine me.

Ego sum Sostrata.

Ubi ea est!
Teipsam quaerito, te expecto, oppido opportune te obtulisti mihi
Obviam hera.

Quid est? quid trepidas?

Hei mihi!

Quid festinas, mi
Geta? animum recipe.

Prorsus.

Quid istuc prorsus ergo est?

Periimus.


Obsecro te quid sit.

Jam.

Quid
Jam, Geta?

Aeschinus.

Quid is ergo?

Alienus est ab nostra familia.

Hem, perii, quare?

Amare occoepit aliam.

Vae miserae mihi!

Neque id occulte fert: ab lenone ipsus etipuit palam.

Satin' hoc certum?

Certum: hisce oculis egomet vidi, Sostrata.

Aeschinum,
Nostram vitam omnium, in quo nostrae spes opesque omnes sitae erant,
Qui sine hac jurabat se unum nunquam victurum diem, qui in sui
Gremio positurum puerum dicebat patris, ita obsecraturum,
Ut liceret hanc sibi uxorem ducere.

Hera, lachrymas mitte,

An narremus cuipiam?

Au, Au, mi homo, sanu'^' es?
An proferendum hoc tibi videtur esse usquam?

Mihi quidem non placet.
Jam primum, illum alieno animo a nobis esse res ipsa indicat.
Nunc si hoc palam proferemus, ille inficias ibit, sat scio,

Fateatur, cum amat aliam, non est utile hanc illi dare; quapropter,
Quoque pacto celato est opus.

Ah, minim gentium; non faci^m.

Quidagis?

Proferarr.

Hem, mea Sostrata, vide quam rem agas.

Pejore res loco non potest esse, quam in quo nunc sita est; primum indotata
est;

Non potest; hoc reliquum est, si inficias ibit, testis mecum est annulus
Quem ipse amiserat; postremo, quando ego conscia mihi sum, a me culpam esse
hanc procul,
Neque pretium, neque rem ullam intercessisse, illa aut me indignam, Geta,
Experiar.

Quid istuc? accedo, ut melius dicas.

Tu quantum potes,
Hegioni cognato hujus rem enarrato omnem ordine;
Nam is nostro Simulo fuit summus, nos coluit maxim.

Nam he^cle
Alius nemo respicit nos.

Propera tu, mea Canthara, cur,
Obstetricem accerse, ut, cum opus sit, no in mora nobis siet.

I Am quite undone, I have heard that my son Ctesipho was with Aeschinus
In the taking the wench away. This evil remains to make me miserable, if he
can also dra^ him to lewdness,
Who is for any employment. Where should I seek him?
I think he is drawn away into a stew somewhither, I am sure that dishonest
fellow hath persuaded him.
Syrus going; I shall know of him, where he is, and truly he
Is one of that crew? if he perceive that I am looking for him; the hang man
Will never tell me, I will not let him see that I desire that.

We have told the old-man erewhile all the matter in order how it is,
I never saw one more merry.

O Iupiter, to see the folly of the man.

He commended


I am ready to burst asunder.

He told the money forthwith: he gave us half a piece besides towards the
charges;
That was laid out indeed as we would have it.

Ho, you should commit it to this fellow,
If you would have any thing well looked unto.

Ho, Demea, I did not see you.
How goes all?

How goes all? I cannot sufficien^lie wonder at your course of life.


Fishes: let that great conger play in the water
A little while: it shall be garbaged when I come, I will not have it done
before.

That these
Lewd pranks should be done!

Truly they do not like me, and I often cry out,
Stephanio, see that these salt-meats be well watered.

O strange?

My son? woe is me poor man; me thinks I n^w see that day, when
He being in want shall run herehence somewhither to be a soldier;

O Demea,
That is wisdom, not only to see what is present, but also
To foresee those things which are to come.

What? is that singing wench now at the house?



Whoo, will he have her at home?

I think so, he is so mad.

That these lewd pranks should be done!

The foolish lenity of his father, and his naughty
Gentleness.

Truly I am ashamed, and it irketh me that he is my brother.

There is too much difference betwixt you,
Demea, and I do not say this because you are here present, there is too too
much.
You, how great soever you are, are all wisdom; he is become otherwise,


Would I suffer him?
Or would not I have smelt it out full six months before he had attempted any
thing?

Do you tell me of your vigilant care?

Let him now be as he is, I pray you.

As a father would have his son to be, so he is.

What have you seen him to day?

Your
Son? (I will set him packing hence into the country) I think he is doing
something in the country a good while ago.



Who my self went a gate-ward with him.

It is very well.
I was afraid lest he should have been hankering here.

And very angry too.

And why so?

He fell a chiding his brother at the market for this singing wench.

Say you so indeed?

Whoo, he lained nothing; for by chance as the money was paying,
The fellow came upon him at unawares, he began to cry out, Aeschinus,

Our pedigree?

O, I weep for joy.

Thou doest not lose
This money, but thy life.

God bless him, I hope, he is like
His ancestors.

Whoo.

O Syrus, he is full of these documents.

He had one at home, of whom he might learn.

A great deal of pains is taken in it.

As into a looking glass, and to take to himself example by others. Do this.

Well indeed.

Avoid this.

Wisely.

This is for your commendation.

There is the cream of the matter.

This is for your discredit.

Very well.

And furthermore.

Truly I have no leisure now
To hearken to you; I have gotten fish according to my desire; I must have a
care

Not to do those things you spoke on erewhile; and, as far forth as I am able,
I instruct my fellow-servants after that same manner; this is salt, this is
burnt,
This is not well washed; that is well, remember to do so again. I advise them
diligently
All I can as far as my skill reaches. Finally, I bid them, Demea,

To be done. I think these are fond things which we do. But what should one do?
As a man is, so you must humour him. Would you had any thing else?

I wish you have more wit
Given you.

Are you going hence into the country?

Straightway.

For what should you do here?


But I am going hence,
Seeing he for whose sake I came hither, is gone into the country: I care for
him
Only, he pertains to me. Seeing my brother will have it so, let him look to
That other. But who is yond, that I see a good way off? Is not this Hegio,
One of our kindred? if my sight fail me not, it is he verily. Ha, a man

Of such citizens now-a-daies; a down-right honest and faithful man.
I know not of any harm that ever he did to the Common-wealth.
How glad am I when I see any remnants of this stock?
Ha, now I joy to live I will tarry for the man here,


DIsperii, Ctesiphonem audivi filium una affuisse in raptione
Cum Aeschino. Id misero restat mihi mali, si illum potest, qui^ alicui
Rei est, etiam ad nequitiam eum adducere. Ubi ego illum quaetam?
Credo abductum in ganeum, aliquo; persuasit ille impurus sat scio.
Syrum ire video; hinc scibo jam, ubi siet. Atque hercle hic
De grego illo est: si me senserit cum quaeritare, nunquam dicet
Carnusex; non ostendam id me velle.

Omnem rem modo seni, quo pacto haberet, enarramus ordine,
Nihil vidi quicquam laetius.

Proh Jupiter, hominis stultitiam!

Collaudavit


Disrumpor.

Argentum adnumeravit illi^o; dedit praeterea in sumptum dimidium
Minae. Id distributum sane ex sententia est.

Hem, huic mandes,
Si quid recte curatum velis.

Ehem, Demea, haud aspexeram
Te; quid agitur?

Quid agatur? vostram nequeo mirari satis rationem.


Purga, Dromo: congrum istum maximum in aqua sinito luder^
Paulisper: ubi ego venero exossabitur; prius nolo.

Haeccine
Flagitia!

Mihi quidem non placent, clamo saepe;
Salsamenta haec, Stephanio, fac macerentur pulchre.

Dii vestram fidem!

Guatum? vae misero mihi! videre videor jam diem illum, cum
Hinc egens profugiet aliquo militatum.

O Demea,
Istuc sapere est, non quod ante pedes modo est videre, sed etiam illa
Quae futura sunt, prospicere.

Quid? istaec jam penes vos Psaltria est?



Eho, an domi est habiturus?

Credo, ut est dementia.

Haec^ine fieri flagitia?

Inepta lenitas patris, facilitas
Prava.

Fra^ris me quidem pudet, pigetque.

Nimium inter vos,
Demea, ac non quia ades praesens dico hoc, pernimium;
Interest. Tu quantus, quantus, nihil nisi sapientia es: ille fit aliter,


Sinerem illum?
Aut non sex totis mensibus prius olfecissem, quam illc quicquam ceperit?

Vigilantiam tuam tu mihi narras?

Sic siet modo, ut nunc, quaeso.

Ut quisque suum vult esse, ita est.

Quid? eum vidistin' body.

Tuumne
Filium. (Abigam hinc rus,) jam dudum aliquid ruri agere arbitror.



Quid egomet produxi.

Optume est,
Metui, no haereret hic.

Atque iratum admodum.

Quid autem?

Adortus est jurgio fratrem apud forum de psaltria hac.

Ain'vero?

Vah, nihil reticuit; nam ut numerabatur forte argentum,
Intervenit homo de improviso, coepit clamare, Aeschine,

Genere nostro?

Oh, lacrymo gaudio.

No tu hoc
Argentum perdis, sed vitam tuam.

Salvus sit; spero, est similis
Majorum suorum.

Hui.

Sire, praeceptorum plenus est istorum
Ille.

Domi habuit, unde disceret.

Fit sedulo.

In speculum vitas omnium jubeo, atque ex aliis sumere
Exemplum sibi. Hoc facito.

Recte sane.

Hoc fugito.

Callide.

Hoc laudi est.

Istaec res est

Hoc vitio datur:

Probissime.

Porro autem.

Non hercle otium est nunc mihi

Corrumpantur cautio est. Nam id nobis tam flagitium est, quam illa
Demea, non facere vobis, quae modo dixti,, quod queo,
Conservis ad eundem istunc praecipio modum: hoc salsum est, hoc adustum est,
Hoc lautum est parum: illud recte, iterum memento. Sedulo

In patinas, Demea, inspicere jubeo, moneo quid sacto
Usus siet. Inepta haec esse nos quae facimus sentio. Verum, quid facias?
Ut homo est, ita morem geras. Numquid vis?

Mentem vobis meliorem
Dari.

In rus hinc abis?

Recta.

Number quid tu hic agas?


Ego vero hinc
Abeo, quando is, quamobrem huc veneram, rus abiit; illum curo
Unum, ille ad me attinet. Quando ita vult frater, de istoc
Ipse viderit. Sed quis illic est, procul quem video? Estne hic Hegio,
Tribulis noster? si satis cerno, is hercle est. Vah, homo

Magna nobis civium penuria est; homo antiqua virtute
Ac fide: Haud scio mali quid ortum ex hoc sit public.
Quam gaudeo, ubi hujus generis reliquias restare
Video? Vah, vivere etiam nunc lubet. Opperiar hominem


OStrange: a base unworthy fact, Geta,
What is this thou tell me?

It is so as I say.

That such an un-gentlemanly prank
Should be committed by one of that family? O Aeschinus,
Truly you have not learned this of your father.

Surely

Being but a stranger; his father makes nothing of it: woe is me,
I wish he were somewhere here by, and might hear these things.

Unless they do, what things its fit they should do, they shall not carry it
away thus.

All our hope doth rely upon you, Hegio.

That old-man when he died, bequeathed us to you,
If you forsake us we are undone.

See you say not so;
Neither will I do it, neither do I think I can do it with any show of
honesty.

I will go to him; I bid you most heartily good morrow Hegio.

Demea.

But what is the matter?

Your elder son Aeschinus,
Whom you gave to your brother to be adopted, hath neither done the part
Of an honest man nor a gentleman.

What is that?

Did you know Simulus a friend of ours,


what else?

He hath deflowered
His daughter being a maid.

Ha!

Tarry Demea, you have not yet heard
That which is the worst.

Is there any thing more yet?

Yes indeed more: for this is in some way to be born withal,
For the night, love, wine, and youth persuaded thereto;

Of his own accord to the maids mother, weeping, entreating, beseeching,
Promising, and swearing, that he would marry her and take her home to him.
It was unknown, it was kept silent, it was believed; the maid
Came to be great with child upon that deflourment: this is the tenth month.

That he may live withal, and forsake her.

Do you tell me these things for a certainty?

The maid's mother
Is ready to witness it, the maid her self, the matter it self; This Geta
Besides, as the condition of the servant is, no bad one,

The whole family: take him aside, tie him neck and heels, enquire the matter
out of him.

Nay indeed rack me, if it be not so done, Demea;
Lastly he will not himself deny it, let me have him face to face.

I am ashamed, neither do I know what to do, nor what to answer this man:

Juno Lucina,
Help me, save me, I beseech thee.

What now, I pray thee, is she crying five loaves a penny?

Yes Hegio.

She craves your aid, Demea,
That she may obtain that by good-will, which the law compels you to;
I pray God, that these things may first be done, as it becomes you:
Demea, I will defend her
To the utmost of my power, and him that is deceased.
He was my kinsman: we were brought up together being little ones
Even since we were children, we have been always together in the wars
And at home; we have endured a great deal of penury together.

I will lose my life rather then I will forsake them.
What answer do you give me?

I will talk with my brother, Hegio;
What advice he shall give me in this matter, that I will sollow.

But, Demea, see you consider this with your self,

Rich, fortunate, gallant,
So much the more it behooveth you to understand with an even mind
The things that are equal, if you will have your selves be accounted honest
men.

Come back again: all things shall be done, which it is fitting should be done.

Geta, lead me the way to Sostrata.

These things are not done but by consent; I wish this might be only
The last prank, but that too much liberty
Will certainly come to some great mischief or other.
I will go, I will seek out my brother, that I may ease my stomach of these
things upon him.

PRoh Dii immortales! facinus indignum, Geta,
Quid narras?

Sic est.

Ex illa familia
Tam illiberale facinus esse ortum? O Aeschine,
Pol haud paternum istuc dedisti.

Videlicet,

Alieno: pater is nihili pen et; hei mihi,
Utinam hic proper adesset alicubi, atque audiret haec.

Nisi facient, quae illos aequum est, haud sic auferent.

In te spes omnis, Hegio, nobis sita est:

Ille tibi moriens nos commendavit s^nex,
Si deseris tu, periimus.

Cave dixeris,
Neque faciam, neque me satis pie posse arbitror.

Adibo? jubeo salvere Hegionem plurimum.

Demea,

Quid autem?

Major filius tuus Aeschinus
Quem fratri adoptandum dedisti, neque boni
Neque liberalis functus officium est viri.

Quid istuc?

Nostrum amicum noras Simulum,


Quid ni?

Filiam ejus virginem
Vitiavit.

Hem!

Mane, nondum audisti, Demea,
Quod est gravissimum.

An quidquam etiam amplius?

Verq amplius; nam hoc quidem ferendum aliquo modo est,
Persuasit nox, amor, vinum, adolescentia;

Venit ipsus ultro, lachrymans, orans, obsecrans,
Fidem dans, jurans se illam ducturum domum.
Ignotum est, tacitum est, creditum est; virgo ex eo
Compressu gravida facta est; mensis hic decin us est.

Paravit, quicum vivat, illam deserat.

Pro certon' tu istaec dicis?

Matter virginis
In medio est, ipsa virgo, res ips^; hic Geta
Praeterea, ut captus est servulorum, non malus*

Sustentat; hunc abduce, vinci, quaere rem.

Immo hercle extorque, nisi ita factum est, Demea,
Postremo now negabit, coram ipsum cedo.

Pudet, neque quid agam, neque quid huic respondeam, scio.

Iuno* Lucina,
Fer opem, serva me, obsecro.

Hem! numnam illa, quaeso, parturit?

Certe Hegio.

Illaec fidem nostram implorat, Demea,
Quod vos jus cogit, id voluntate ut impetret;
Haec primum ut fiant, deos quaeso, ut vobis decet:
Demea.
Summa vi defendam hanc, atque illum mortuum.
Cognatus mihi erat; una a pueris pa^vuli
Sumus educti: una semper militiae domi
Fuimus; paupertatem una pertulimus gravem.

Animam relinquam potius quam illas deseram.
Quid mihi respondes?

Fratrem conveniam, Hegio,
Is quod mihi de hac re dederit consilium, id sequar.

Sed, Demea, hoc tu facito tecum animo cogites,

Potentes, dites, fortunati, nobiles,
Tam maxim vos aequo animo aequa noscere
Oportet, si vos vultis perhiberi probos.

Redito; fient, quae fieri aequum est, omnia.

Geta, duc me ad Sostratam.

Non, me indicente, haec fiunt; utinam hoc sit modo
Defunctum, verum nimia illa licentia
Profecto evadet in aliquod magnum malum.
Ibo, requiram fratrem, ut in eum haec evomam.

SOstrata, see you have a good heart, and see you clear up that Daughter of
yours
As well as you can; I will go talk with Mitio, if he be at the market,
And tell him orderly how the matter stands.
If it be, that he will do that which he ought to do,

Let him give me an answer, that I may know as soon as may be what I should do.

BOno animo fac sis, Sostraia, istam quam potes
Fac consoleres ego Mitionem si apud forum est,
Conveniam, atque ut res gesta est, narrabo ordine
Si est facturus ut siet officium suum,
Faciat; sin aliter de hac^re est ejus sententia,
Respondeat mihi, ut, quid agam, quamprimu^* sciam.

DO you say my father is gone hence into the country?

Long ago.

I pray thee tell me truly:

He is at his farm-house. And I believe he is very hard now at some work.

I wish indeed, so it may be with his safety, that he may so weary himself,
As that he may not be able at all to rise out of his bed for these three days
together.



Ey! for
I earnestly desire to spend all this day in merriment, as I have begun; and I
utterly dislike
That countrie-farm for no reason so much, as because it is neer-hand; but if
it were
Further off, the night would overtake him there, before he could return hither
Again. Now when he shall not see me there, he will come running hither again
by and by,

All the day long. What should I say?

Is no excuse come into your mind?

No nothing at all.

You are so much the worse. Have you no client, friend, or guest?

I have; what then?

Tell him, you attended on these.

Which attendance was not given;
This cannot be done.

It may.

On the day time. But if I tarry here all night,
Syrus?

Oh, how heartily I could wish it were a custom
To attend our friends also by night. But do you rest your self secure,
I know his pulse very well. When he is as hot as a roast, I make him
As quiet as a lamb.

How?

He delights to hear you commended,
I set you out as a little God to him, I tell him of all your good qualities.

Mine?


Oh but see yonder for you?

What is the matter?

Here's the man we talk of.

Is my father here?

It is just he.

Syrus, what shall we do?

Get you but in now,
I will look to it.

If he ask you any thing concerning me, say you saw me no where. Do you hear?

Can you command your self to give over your prate?

A In' patrem hinc abiisse rus?

Jam dudum.

Dic sodes,

Apud villam est. Nunc autem maxim operis aliquid facere
Credo.

Utinum quidem, quod cum salute ejus fiat, ita se defatigarit;
Velim, ut triduo hoc perpetuo e lecto prorsus nequeat surgere.



Ita; nam hunc diem
^sere cupio, ut cepi, perpetuum in laetitia degere; illud rus
Nulla al a causa tam male odi, nisi quia proper est; quod si abesset
Longius, prius nox oppressisset illic, quam huc reverti posset
Iterum. Nunc ubi me illic non videbit, jam huc recurret,

Vidi die, quid dicam?

Nihilne in mentem?

Nunquam quidquam:

Tanto nequiores. Cliens, amicus, hospes nemo est vobis?

Sunt, quid postea?

Hisce opera ut data sit.

Quae non
Data sit? non potest fieri.

Potest.

Interdiu; sed si hic
Sire?

Vah, quam vellem etiam
Noctu amicis operam mos esset dari. Quin tu otiosus es, ego
Illius sensum pulchre calleo. Cum fervet maxim, tam placidum
Quam ovem reddo.

Quo modo?

Laudarier te audit
Lubenter, facio te apud illum Deum, virtutes narrow:

Meas?


Hem tibi autem?

Quidnam?

Lupus est in fabula.

Pater adest?

Ipsus est.

Sire, quid agimus?

Fuge modo intro.
Ego videro.

Si quid rogabit, nusquam tu me: audistin'?

Potin' es, ut desinas?

Verily I am an unfortunate man; first I can find my brother no where
In all the world. And besides, as I was looking for him, saw a day tale man
Coming from my farm, he saith my son is not in the country; and I know not
what to do.

Syrus,

What say you?

Is he looking for me?

Yes.

I am undone.

But be of good cheer.


But that I think I am born to this thing, to suffer miseries.
I am the first that perceive our mishaps, I am the first that know all things,
And I am the first that carry the news of them; I am the only man that am
grieved at it, if any thing be done amiss.

I cannot but laugh as this man, he saith he is the first that knows and he
alone is ignorant of all things.



Syrus,
I pray thee have a care that he rush not himself quite in hither.

What can you hold your peace?
I will have a care.

Truly I will never to day adventure that thing with you:
For I will pen up my self with her in some close room: that is the safest
course.

Do it, yet I will set this man packing.

But lo where your roguish Syrus is?


Verily I would faign know, how many masters I have: what a misery is this?

What is he yelping like a fox? what would he have? what say you you honest
man? Is my brother at home?

What do you say honest man to me, with a mischief? verily I am an undone man.

What ails you?

Ctesipho hath quite killed me poor man, and that singing wench
With buffeting.

Ha, what story you tell?

Oh, do you see how he hath cut my lip?

Why so?

He saith, she was bought by persuasion.

Did not you say
You went agateward with him lately into the country from hence?

So I did, but he came afterwards
Like a mad-man, he made no spare of any thing. Should not he have been ashamed
to beat


I commend thee Ctesipho, thou dost follow thy fathers steps; go thy way, I
take thee to be a man.

Do you commend him? he will hold his hands hereafter, if he be wise.

Valiantly done.

Very valiantly, because he hath overcome a poor woman, and me
A poor slave, that durst not strike again: Whoo, it was very valiantly done.


But is my brother within?

He is not.

I muse, where I may seek him.

I know where he is,
But I will not tell you to day.

Ha, what say you?

So.

I will be sure to beat out thy brains now.

But I know not the name
Of that man, but I know the place where he is.

Tell me the place then.



Why should 1
But know it?

Go straight along this street to the upper end; when you come there,
There is a down-hill towards the lower end; haste your self this way;
afterwards there is
A chapel on this hand, there is a by-corner hard by.

What one?

There where
There is also a great wild fig-tree; do you know it?

I know it.

Go on this way.


True indeed, ah,
Do you not perceive that I am a man? I am mistaken; ^ome back again to the
porch,
Indeed you will go a great deal nearer this way, it is not so ill to hit.
Do you know this rich man Cratinus's house?

I know it.

You are gone past it,
Go on the left hand straight along this street; when you come at Diana's
temple,

There is a mil-house, and over against it there is a joiners shop; there he
is.

What doth he there?

He hath put out some tables to be made with holm feer,
Whereon you may drink in the sun-shine.

Very well indeed: but do I m^ke no more haste to go to him?

Get you gone for sooth; I will set you on work to day, as you deserve, you old
dotard.
Aeschinus loytereth tediously; the dinner is spoiled;
Ctesipho is in love up to the ears: I will now look to my self.
For I will now go, and take every thing that is the most tooth some,
And tippling off the pots by little and little, I will draw this day to an
end.

NAe ego homo sum infaelix; primum fratrem nusquam invenio
Gentium. Praeterea autem dum illum quaero, a villa mercenarium
Vidi; is filium negat esse ruri: nec quid agam scio.

Sire,

Quid ais?

Men' quaerit?

Verum.

Perii.

Quin tu animo bono es.


Nisi me credo huic esse natum rei, ferendis miseriis.
Primus sentio mala nostra, primus rescisco omnia,
Primus porro obnuncio: aegre solves, si quid fit, fero.

Rideo hunc, primum ait se scire, is solves nescit omnia.



Sire,
Obsecro, vide no ille huc prorsus se irruat.

Etiam taces?
Ego cavebo.

Nunquam hercle ego body istuc committam tibi.
Nam me in cellam aliquam cum illa concludam; id tutissimum est.

Age, tamen ego hunc amovebo.

Sed eccum sceleratum Syrum!


Scire equidem volo, quot mihi sint domini: quae est haec miseria!

Quid ille gannit? quid vult? quid ais bone vir? est frater domii?

Quid, malum, bone vir, mihi narras? equidem perii.

Quid tibi est?

Ctesipho me pugnis miserum, istam psaltriam
Usque occidit.

Hem, quid narras?

Hem, vides, ut discidit labrum.

Quamobr^m?

Me impulsore hanc emptam esse ait.

Non tu eum
Rus hinc modo produxe aiebas?

Factum; verum venit post
Insaniens, nihil pepercit; non puduisse verberare hominem


Laudo, Ctesipho, patrissas; abi, virum te judico.

Laudasne? ille continebit posthac, si sapiet, manus.

Fortiter.

Perquam, quia miseram mulierem, me servolum
Qui referire non audebam, vicit; hui, perfortiter.


Sed estne frater intus?

Non est.

Ubi illum quaeram, cogito.

Scio ubi sit,
Verum body nunquam monstrabo.

Hem, quid ais?

Ita.

Diminuetur tibi quidem jam cerebrum.

At nomen nescio
Illius hominis; sed locum novi ubi sit.

Dic ergo locum.



Quid ni
Noverim?

Praeterito hac recta platea sursum; ubi eo veneris,
Clivos deorsum versus est, hac te praecipitato; postea est ad hanc
Manum sacellum, ibi angiportum propter est.

Quodnam?

Illic ubi
Etiam caprificus magna est; nostin'?

Novi.

Ha^ pergito^



Verum hercle, vah,
Censen' hominem me esse? erravi; in porticum rursum redi,
Sane hac multo propius ibis, minor est erratio.
Scin' Cratini hujus ditis aedes?

Scio.

Ubi eas praeterieris,
Ad finistram hac recta platea: ubi ad Dianae veneris,

Est pistrilla, ex adverso fabrica, ibi est.

Quid ibi facit?

Lectulos in sole ilignis pedibus faciundos dedit,
Ubi potetis vos.

Been sane; sed cesso ad eum pergere?

I sane, ego te exercebo body, ut dignus es, silicernium;
Aeschinus odiose cessat: prandium corrumpitur:
Ctesipho autem in amore est totus: ego jam prospiciam mihi.
Nam jam adibo, at{que} unumquod{que} quod quidem erit bellissimu,
Carpam, cyathos sorbillans paulatim, hunc producam diem

I Find nothing in this matter, Hegio, why I should be so much c^mended,
I do but my duty, I amend what we have done a^sse.
Unless you think me to be one of those men, who think thus
That they have an injury done them, if they have done one themselves
wilfully, they themselves complain,
And cry whore first, because I have not done so, you give me thanks.

Ah no, I never thought you to be otherwise then you are:
But, I pray you, Mitio, go with me to the maids mother,
And tell the woman your self those very same things which you told me;
That this suspicion is for his brother and the singing wench.



You do well:
For you will both ease her heart, who wastes away with grief
And misery, and you will discharge the duty of an honest man as you are; but
if you be minded otherwise,
I my self will tell her, what you have told me.

Nay, I will go.

You do well.
All people, with whom the world goes not very well, are more supitious; I
know not how,

They always think they are neglected for their infirmity
Wherefore it is more pacifying for you to excuse your self to her face to
face.

You say well, and truly.

Follow me in then this way.

Yes.

EGo in hac re nihil reperio, quam ob rem lauder tantopere,
Hegio. Meum officium facio, quod peccatum a nobis est, corrigo.
Nisi si me in illo credidisti esse homi^u^ numero, qui ita putant
Sibi fieri injuriam, ultro siquam fecere, ipsi expostulant;
Et ultro accusant: id quia non est a me factum, agis gratias.

Ah, minim; nunquam te aliter at{que} es, in animu induxi meu.
Sed quaeso, ut una mecum ad matrem virginis eas, Mitio.
Atque istaec eadem, quae mihi dixti, tute dicas mulieri:
Suspicione hanc propter fratre ejus esse, illam psalteriam.



Been facis:
Nam illi animum jam revelabis, quae dolor ac miseria
Tabescit, tuo officio fueris functus; sed si aliter putas,
Egomet narrabo quae mihi dixti.

Imo ego ibo.

Been facis.
Omnes, quibus res sunt minus secundae, magis sunt, nescio quomodo,

Propter suam impotentiam, se semper credunt negligi.
Quapropter te ipsum purgare ipsi coram, placabilius est.

Et certe, veru dicis.

La me, ego hac intro.

Maxim.

I Am vexed in my mind, that this so great a mischief should be objected to me
on a suddoin,
That I cannot be certain what do with my self, nor what course to take.
My limbs are enfeebled with fear, my mind is astonished through affrightment,
No counsel at all can stand in my heart.

Hath now light upon me, and that not without cause. Sostrata thinks.
That I bought this singing wench for my self: the old woman discovered that to
me;
For as she by chance was sent hence to the mid-wife, as soon as I saw her,
I went presently to her, I ask her how Pamphila did, whether she was near her
labour,
Aeschinus,
You have now deceived us long enough; your promise hath hitherto
Sufficiently frustrated us: Alas, quoth I, what is the matter, I pray you?
You may fare well, you may have her that likes you. I perceived presently,
that they suspected that;
Yet nevertheless I with-held my self, lest I should utter any thing
concerning my brother to that blab,

To be uttered. Well, I let it pass, it may come to pass, that it may not come
out any way.
This is the very thing I fear, lest they believe it, there are so many
likeliehoods concur.
I my self took her away by force; I my self paid the money; she is brought
away
Home to me: moreover I confess these things were done through my default,
that I told not this thing

Hitherto I have been negligent; now Aeschinus henceforth bestir thy self.
Now this is to be done first and foremost; I will go to them, to clear my
self, I will come to the door.
I am undone, I always tremble every bone of me, when I begin to knock at
this door, poor man that I am.
Ho ho, it is I Aeschinus, some of you open the door quickly.


DIscrucior animi, hoccine de improviso mali mihi objici tantum,
Ut neque quid de me faciam, neque quid agam, certum siet.
Membra metu debilia sunt; animus timore obstupuit,
Pectore consistere nihil consilii quidquam potest.

Suspicion deem incidit, no{que} ea immerito Sostrata credit
Mihi me psalteriam hanc emisse; id anus mihi judicium fecit;
Nam ut hinc forte ea ad obstetricem erat missa, ubi vidi eam,
Illico accedo, rogito Pamphila quid agate, jam partus adsiet,
Aeschine,
Satis diu dedisti verba nobis, satis adhuc tua nos
Frustrata est sides; hem, quid istuc, obsecro, inquam, est?
Valeas, habeas illam quae placet. Sensi illico id illas suspicari:
Sed me reprehendi tamen, no quid de fratre garrulae illi faverem,

Est opus efferri. Age, mitto, fieri potis est, uti no qua exeat.
Ipsum id metuo no credant, tot concurrunt verisimilia.
Egomet rapui; ipse egomet solvi argentum; ad me abducta est
Domum: haec adeo mea culpa fateor fieri, non me hanc rem patri

Cessatum us{que} adhuc est; nunc por^o, Aeschine, expergiscere.
Nunc hoc est primum; ad illas ibo, ut purgem me, accedam ad fores,
Perii, horresco semper, ubi pulsare hasce occipio fores, miser.
Heus, heus, Aeschinus ego sum, aperite aliquis actutum ostium.


SOstrata, do as you said. I will go talk with Aeschinus,
That he may know how these things are carried. But who knocked at the door?

Truly it is my father, I am undone.

Aeschinus.

What business hath be here?

Did you knock at this door? he saith never a word. Why do I not play upon a
little while?

Do you make me no answer?

Truly I did not knock at this door, that I know of.

Say you so? for I wondered what business you had here.
He blushes; All is well.

I pray you tell me, father,
What business had you here?

I had no business truly.

To be a dayes-man for him here.

What?

I will tell you.
There are certain poor women dwell here,
I suppose, and I am sure, you do not know them;
For it is not long since they flitted hither.

What more then?



Go on.

This maid is fatherless.
This friend of mine is the next a-kin to her,
The Laws constrain him to marry her.

I am undone.

What is the matter?

Nothing; well, go on.

He is come to carry her away with him,
For he dwells at Miletum.

Ah, to have the maid away with him?



As far as Miletum I pray you?

Yes.

I am sick at the heart.
What say the women?

What do you think they say? for they can say nothing.
The mother feigned that there is a child born by another man,
I cannot tell who, for she doth not name him:
And that he is the first, and therefore that she ought not to be given to this
man.



No.

I beseech you, no? father, shall he have her away hence?

Why should he not have her away?

It is harshly done of you,
And unmercifully; and if it be lawful for me, father,
To speak more plainly, ungentlemanly.



Ask you me? what heart at length do you think
Will that poor man have, that kept her company before,
(Who forlorn man, I know not well, whether he love her dearly now or no)
When being by he shall see her taken from him by force before his face,
As to be had away out of his sight? O father, it is an unworthy action.


To whom, when was she married? who is the principal contriver of these
matters?
Why hath he married another man's sweet-heart?

Ought such a great maid
To sit at home, waiting till her kinsman should come
From thence hither? these things, father,


You cox-comb, should I plead against him,
For whom I came to be an advocate? But, Aeschinus, what are these things
Concerning us? or what have we to do with them? let us go hence; what is the
matter?
Why do you weep?

Father, I beseech you, hear me.

Aeschinus,

Are a greater care to me.

I wish you may love me as one that deserves, your love,
Whilst you live, father, as it heartily grieves me, that I should have taken
This fault upon me, and I am ashamed of my self for your sake.

I believe it indeed, for I know your good nature:

In what city I pray you do you think you live?
You have deflowered a maid, which it was not lawful for you to touch.
Now that is a very great offence, yet of humane frailty.
Others and good men have done so oftentimes. But since this thing fell out,
tell me,

What might be done? what way it might be done? if you your self were ashamed
to Iell me,
Which way should I know? whilst you are at a stand about these things the ten
months are gone about:
You have betrayed your self, and her poor woman, and your son, as far as was
in your power.
What? did you think that God would do this for you whilst you were asleep?

I would not have you be careless of other things af^tr the same manner.
Have a good heart, you shall marry her.

Ha!

Have a good heart, I say.

Father, I pray you, do you now befool me?

I be fool you? wherefore?

I know not, because I so greatly covet this to be true, I am therefore the
more afraid.


What? shall I now marry a wife?

Now.

Just now?

Just now, as fast as you can.

I wish I were dead, father, if I do not now love you more then these eyes of
mine own.

What? better then her?

As well.

Very kindly.

What? where is
That Milesian?

He is gone, he is dashed, he hath taken ship. But why do you linger?


Grant your request, because you are the virtuous man far away.

I will go in, that such things as are needful may be got ready; do you as I
told you,
If you be wise.

What business is this? is this to be a father?
Or is this this to be a son? If he were my brother or fellow-companion, how
could be

To be hugd in ones bosom? Therefore hath he laid on me a great care
By his kindness towards me, lest peradventure I should do anything
Unawares, which he would not have me to do. Now I know it, I will take heed.
But do I make no haste
To get in, lest I be a cause of delay to my own marriage!

ITa ut dixisti, Sostrata, facite: ego Aeschinum conveniam,
Ut quo modo acta haec sunt, sciat. Sed quis ostium hoc pulsavit?

Pater hercle est, perii:

Aeschine.

Quid huic h^c negotii?

Tune has pepulisti fores? tacet. Cur non ludo hunc aliquantisper?

Nihil me respondes?

Non equidem istas, quod sciam.

Ita? nam mirabar, quid hic negotii esset tibi.
Erubuit, salva res est.

Dic sodes, pater,
Tibi vero quid istic res est?

Nihil mihi quidem.

Huc advocatum sibi.

Quid?

Ego dicam tibi,
Habitant hic quaedam mulieres pauperculae,
Ut opinor, has non nosse re, certe scio;
Neque enim diu huc commigrarunt.

Quid tum postea?



Perge.

Haec virgo orba est patre.
Hic meus amicus illi genere est proximus.
Huic Leges cogunt nubere hanc.

Perii.

Quid est?

Nihil; recte, perge.

Is venit, ut secum avehat,
Nam habitat Mileti.

Hem, virginem ut secum avehat?



Miletum usque obsecro?

Ita.

Animo male est.
Quid ipsae aiunt?

Quid istas censes? nihil enim.
Commenta matter est esse ex alio viro,
Nescio quo, puerum natum, neque eum nominat,
Priorem esse illum, non oportere huic dari.



Non.

Obsecro, non? an illam hinc abducet pater?

Quidni illam abducat?

Factum a vobis duriter,
Immisericorditerque; atque etiam si est, pater,
Dicendum magis aperte, illiberaliter.



Rogas me? quid illi tandem creditis
Fore animi misero, qui cum illa consuevit prius,
(Qui infelix, haud scio, an illam misere nunc amat,)
Cum hanc sibi videbit praesens praesenti eripi,
Abduci ab oculis? facinus indignum pater.


Cui, quando nupsit? author his rebus quis est?
Cur duxit alienam?

An sedere oportuit
Domi virginem tam grandem, dum cognatus huc
Illinc veniret exspectantem? haec, mi pater,


Ridiculum, advorsumne illum causam dicerem,
Cui veneram advocatus? Sed quid ista, Aeschine,
Nostra? aut quid nobis cum illis? abeamus: quid est?
Quid lachrymas?

Pater, obsecro, ausculta.

Aeschine,

Quae agis curae sunt mihi.

Ita velim me promerentem ames,
Dum vivas, mi pater, ut me hoc delictum admisisse
In me id mihi vehementer dolet; me tui pudet.

Credo hercle, nam ingenium novi tuum

In qua civitate tandem te arbitrare vivere?
Virginem vitiasti, quam te jus non fuerat tangere.
Jam id peccatum primu magnum, at humanu tamen.
Fecere item alii saepe boni. At postquam id evenit, cedo,

Quid fieret, qua fieret? Si te ipsum mihi puduit dicere,
Qua resciscerem? haec dum dubitas, menses abie^e december:
Prodidisti te, illam miseram, natum, quod quidem in te fuit.
Quid? credebas dormienti haec tibi confecturos Deos?

Nolo c^erarum rerum te socordem eodem modo.
Bono animo es, duces urorem hanc.

Hem.

Bono animo es, inquam.

Pater, obsecro, number ludis tu nunc me?

Ego te? quamobrem?

Nescio, quia tam misere hoc esse cupio verum, ideo vereor magis.



Quid? jamne uxorem ducam?

Jam.

Jam?

Jam quantum potest.

Dii me, pater, omnes oderint, ni magis te, quam oculos nunc ego amo meos.

Quid? quam illam?

Aeque.

Perbenign^.

Quid? ille ubi est
Milesius?

Abiit, periit, navem ascendit; sed cur cessas?


Quo vir melior multo es, quam ego, obtemperaturos magis.

Ego eo intro, ut quae opus sunt, parentut; tu fac ut dixi,
Si sapis.

Quid hoc negotii? hoc est patrem esse?
Authoc est filium esse? si frater aut sodalis esset, qui magis

Gestandus in sinu est? Hem! itaque adeo magnam mihi
Injecit sua commoditate curam, no forte imprudens
Faciam, quod nolit; sciens cavebo. Sed cesso ire
Intro, no mora meis nuptiis egomet siem!

I Am weary with walking up and down; I wish great Jupiter would bring on thee
Some mischief with that thy showing me the way, Syrus.
I have gone creeping quite over all the town, to the gate, to the pool,
Whither not? neither was there any carpenter's shop there, nor did a^i^ man
say

At his house till he come home again.

Efessus sum ambulando: ut, Sire, te cum tua
Monstratione magnus perdat Iupiter.
Perreptavi usque omne oppidum, ad portum, ad lacum,
Quo non? nec fabrica illic ulla erat, nec fratrem homo

Certum obsidere se usque donec redierit.

I will go and tell them, there is no delay in us.

But lo where he is; I have been looking for you a great while, Mitio.

What is the matter?

I bring you other great lewd pranks
Of that honest young-man.

But lo.

New pranks,


Enough, now.

Alas, you know not what a man he is.

I do know.

Ah you fool, you dream that I speak of the singing-wench:
This offence is done against a maid that is a citizen.

I know it.

Ho, do you know it, and suffer it?

What should I do but suffer it?

Tell me.
Do not you cry out? are you not out of your wits?

No, I had rather you were.



God bless him and send him good luck.

The maid hath nothing.

I heard as much.

And must he marry one without a portion?

Ye.

What will now become of it?

That forsooth which the matter affords.
The maid shall be brought over from thence hither.

O Iupiter!
Must it be done on that fashion?

What should I do else?


Certainly it is a wise man's part to make as though it did.

But I have already
Betrothed the maid to him, the matter is concluded, the marriage is to be
made.
I have taken away all fear; these things are rather belonging to a man.

But,
Doth this doing please you, Mitio?

No; if I could tell how

Man's life is so, as when you play at tables,
If that fall not, which is most needful to be cast,
You must amend that by skill, which fell out by chance.

You an amender! for sooth twenty pounds are lost by your skill

As soon as may be, if not for a piece of money, yet for nothing.

Neither is she to be sold, nor indeed doth he desire to sell her.

What will you do then?

She shall be at my house.

O strange!
A whore, and a good-wife of the house under one roof?



Do you think you are well in your wits?

Truly I think so.

I swear, as far as I understand your folly,
I think you will do this, that you may have one to sing with you.

Why not?

And the new married woman shall learn these same things?

Yes forsooth.

And you shall dance among them leading the ring.

Very well.


Woe is me.
Are you not ashamed of these things?

But now, Demea, forbear
That peevishness of yours, and make your self blithe and buxom at your son's
marriage.
I will go talk with these, and come hither again afterwards.

O Jupiter!
Is this a life fit to be led? are these manners to be used? is this madness
to be shown?

A costly house is to be maintained; a young-man is undone by riot;
An old man is turned dotard. Salus her self if she should desire it,
Cannot at all be able to preserve this family from ruin.

IBo, illis dicam, nullam esse in nobis moram.

Sed eccum ipsum; te jam dudum quaero, Mitio.

Quidnam?

Fero alia flagitia ad te ingentia
Boni illius adolescentis.

Ecce autem.

Nova,


Ohe, jam.

Ah, nescis qui vir sier.

Scio.

Ah stulte, tu de psaltria me somnias
Agere: hoc peccatum in virginem est civem.

Scio.

Eho, scis patere?

Quid ni patiar?

Dic mihi,
Non clamas? non infanis?

Non, malim quidem.



Dii been vertant.

Virgo nihil habet.

Audivi.

Et ducenda indotata est?

S ilicet.

Quid nunc futurum est?

Id enim quod res ipsa fert.
Illinc huc transferetur virgo.

O Iupiter!
Istoccine pacto oportet?

Quid faciam amplius?


Simulare certe est hominis.

Quin jam virginem
Despondi, res composita est, fiunt nuptiae.
Dempsi metum omnem; haec magis sunt hominis.

Caeterum,
Placet tibi factum, Mitio?

Non; si queam

Ita vita est hominum, quafi cum ludas tesseris,
Si illud, quod maxim opus est jactu, non cadit,
Illud quod cecidit forte, id art ut corrigas.

Corrector! nempe tua art viginti minae

Aliquo abjicienda est, si non pretio, gratis.

Neque est, neque illam sa^e studet vendere.

Quid igitur facies?

Domi erit.

Proh Deu n fidem!
Meretrix, matter familias una in domo?



Sanum te credis esse?

Equidem arbitror.

Ita me Dii ament, ut video tuam ego ineptiam,
Facturum credo, ut habeas, quicum cantites.

Cur non?

Et nova nupta eadem haec discet?

Scilicet.

Tu inter eas restim ductans saltabis.

Probe.


Hei mihi.
Non te haec pudent?

Jam vero omit, Demea,
Tuam istanc iracundiam: atque ira, uti decet;
Hilarem ac lubentem fac te in nati nuptiis.
Ego hos conveniam, post huc redeo.

O Iuppiter!

Uxor sine dote veniet: intus psaltria est:
Domus sumptuosa: adolescens luxu praeditus:
Senex delirans. Ipsa, si cupiat, Salus,
Servare prorsus non potest hanc familiam.

TRuly, little Syrus, you have looked to your self nicely,
And performed your office daintily.
Go thy way, but after I am stuff^ full of all things within,
It is my pleasure to walk out abroad hither.

See and observe


But behold here is
Our old master. What is done? why are you sad?

Oh you rogue!

So, good-man wise-aker, are you now wasting your words here?

If you were my servant.

Truly, Demea, you would have been a rich-man,
And you would have bettered your estate.

I would have made thee to be


Why so? what have I done?

Dost tho^ ask?
In the very bustle, and in a very great offence,
Which is scarcely ended well enough, you have been tippling, you rogue,
As it were in matter well done.

Truly I wish I had not come forth.

AEDipol, Syrisce, te curasti molliter,
Lauteque munus administrasti tuum.
Abi, sed postquam intus sum omnium rerum satur,
Prodeambulare huc libitum est.

Illud sis vide


Ecce autem hic adest
Senex noster. Quid sit? quid tu es tristis?

Oh scelus!

Ohe, jam tu verba fundis hic sapientia?

Tu si meus esses.

Dis quidem esses, Demea,
Ac tuam rem constabilisses.

Exemplum omnibus


Quamobrem? quid feci?

Rogas?
In ipsa turba atque in peccato maxumo,
Quod vix sedatum satis est, potasti, scelus,
Quasi re been gesta.

Sane, nollem nunc exitum.

HO Syrus, Ctesipho entreats you to come back again.

Go your way.

Why doth this fellow mention Ctesipho?

Nothing.

Ho, you hang-man,
Is Ctesipho within?

He is not.

Why doth this fellow name him?

There is another certain little parasite.
(...). Do you know him?

I will know by and by.

What do you? whither go you?

Let me alone.

Do not, I say.

Will you not hold off your hands, you whipped rogue?
Or had you rather have your brains dashed out?

He is gone.
Truly I think him no fit fellow-reveller,
Especially for Ctesipho. What should I do now?

Into a corner, and sleep out this wine. I will do so.

HEus Sire, rogat te Ctesipho, ut redeas.

Abi.

Quid Ctesiphonem hic narrat?

Nihil.

Eho carnifex,
Est Ctesipho intus?

Non est.

Cur hic nominat?

Est alius quidam parasitaster parvolus.


Jam scibo.

Quid agis? quo abis?

Mitte me.

Noli, inquam.

Non manum abstines, mastigia?
An tibi mavis cerebrum dispergi hic?

Abiit.
Aedipol commessatorem haud sane commodum,
Praesertim Ctesiphoni. Quid ego nunc agam?
Nisi dum have silescunt turbae, interea in angulum
Aliquo abeam, atque edormiscam hoc vini. Sic agam.

WE have made things ready, so as you said, Sostrata,
When you please. Who is that that knocked so hard at my door?

Woe is me, what should I do? what should I cry out on, or complain?
O heaven! O earth! O Neptune's seas!

See thee yonder:
(...). He hath known all the matter; he now cries out on it, without doubt.
He is disposed to brabble, I must help.

Lohere he is,
The common undoer of his children.

At the length repress your anger, and come again to your self.

I have repressed it, I am come again to my self, I forbear all illlanguage.

Moreover it was of your own making, that you should not look after my son,
Nor I after yours; answer me this.

It was so, I do not deny it.

Why is he tippling at your house? why do you entertain my son?
Why do you buy him a sweetheart, Mitio? is it not fit that I should have

Seeing I do not look to your son, do not you look to mine.

You do not say right.

No?

For indeed this is an old-saying,
That all things are common amongst friends.

Wittily said, this proverb is but now sprung up at last.

Demea;
First and foremost if this vex you, what charges your sons
Are at, I pray you consider with your self these things:
You brought up them two according to your estate;
Because you thought your means would be sufficient for them both:
And then you believed forsooth that I would marry:
Keep on that same old wont;
Save, seek, spare, see you leave them as much
As possibly may be, do you get that credit to your self,
Let them make use of my means, which have happened beyond your hope.

Account that for a vantage; if you would, Demea
Rightly consider all these things in your mind,
You would rid both me and your self, and them also of trouble.

I forbear the estate, I speak of their haunt.

Tarry;
Demea,
Many signs in a man, by which a guess may be easily made;
As you may oft times say, when two do the same thing,
This man may do this thing without controlment, that man may not:
Not because the thing is unlike, but the party that doth it:

As we would have it. I see they are witty and understand, and stand inaw
When need serves, they love one another; one may know their gentlemanlie
Nature and disposition; you may reclaim them any day
When you will Yet nevertheless you may be afraid lest they should be
Demea,
We grow more s^ilful in all other matters through age.
This only one fault old age brings upon men,
We are all more diligent about an estate then needs:
Which age will sufficient lie whet them on to.

Mitio let not those good reasons of yours,


Hold your tongue,
It shall n^t be done, let those things pass; be advised by me to day:
Look blithe on it.

Verily, so the time requires,
I must do it; but I will be gone hence with my son into the country
By peep of day.

Nay, I think you may go in the night.


And I will also hurry
That singing-wench hence with me thither.

You shall do a mighty matter.
By this means you shall be sure to tie your son there.
Only look to it, that you keep her.

I will see to that;
And for her, I will make her that she shall be full of ifle^, smoke, and
mill-dust,

I will cause her to gather stubble at the very noon-time of the day;
I will make her as dry and black as a coal is.

I like this well.
Now you seem to me to have some wit in you.

And indeed, I will constrain my son,
Then although he be very loath, that he shall lye with her.



Do you jear me? you are happy, that are of that mind,
I perceive.

Ab do you go on?

Now you give over.

Go your way in then, and in what thing it is requisite,
In that thing let us spend this day merrily.

PArata a nobis sunt, ita ut dixti, Sostrata,
Ubi vis. Quisnam a me pepulit tam graviter fores?

Hei mihi, quid faciam? quid clamem, aut quera^?
O coelum! O terra! O maria Neptuni!

Hem tibi,

Paratae lites, succurrendum est.

Eccum adest,
Communis corruptela suorum libe^um.

Tandem reprime iracundiam, atque ad te redi.

Repressi, redii, mitto maledicta omnia.

Ex te adeo ortum est, no tu curares meum,
Never ego tuum; responde.

Factum est, non nego.

Cur nunc apud tepotat? cur recipis meum?
Cur emis amicam, Mitio? number quid minus

Quando ego tuum non curo, no cura meum.

Non aequum dicis.

Nor?

Nam verus verbum hoc quidem est,
Communia esse amicorum inter se omnia.

Facere, nunc demum istaec nata oration est.

Ausculta paucis, nisi molestum est, Demea;
La si id te mordet, sumptum filii
Quem faciunt, quaeso, facito haec tecum cogites:
Tu illos duos pro re tollebas tua,
Quod satis putabas tua ambobus fore;
Et me tum uxorem credidisti scilicet ducturum;
Eandem illam rationem antiquam obtine;
Conserva, quaere, parce, fac quam plurimum
Illis relinquas, gloriam tu istanc tibi obtine;
Mea, quae praeter spem evenere, utantur, sine.

Id de lucro putato esse: omnia haec si voles,
In animo vere cogitare, Demea,
Et mihi tibi illis dempseris molestiam.

Mitto rem: consuetudinem ipsorum.

Mane:
Demea,
Signa insunt, ex quibus, conjectura facile fit,
Duo cum idem faciunt, saepe ut possis dicere,
Hoc licet impune facere huic, illi non licet:
Non quod dissimilis res sit, sed quod is qui facit;

Ita ut volumus. Video eos sapere, la, in loco
Vereri, inter se amare; scire est liberum
Ingenium atque animum; quovis illos tu die
Reducas. At enim metuas, no ab resint tamen
Demea,
Ad omnia alia aetate sapimus rectius;
Solum unum hoc vitium senectus offer hominibus,
Attentiores sumus ad rem omnes quam sat est:
Quod aetas illos sat acuet.

No nimium
Mitio,
Et tuus iste animus aequus subvortat.

Tace,
Non fiet, mitte istaec; da te body mihi:
Exporge frontem.

Scilicet, ita tempus fert.
Faciendum est; caeterum rus cum filio


Imo, de nocte censeo.
Body modo hilarem te fac.

Et istam psaltriam
Una illuc mecum hinc abstraham.

Pugnaveris.
Eo pacto prorsum illic alligaris filium.
Modo facito, ut illam serves.

Ego istoc videro;

Coquendo sit, faxo; molendo; praeter haec
Meridie ipso faciam, ut stipulam colligat:
Tam excoctam reddam atque atram, quam ^arbo est.

Placet.
Nunc mihi videris sapere.

Atque equidem filium


Hoc est sapere.

Derides? fortunatus, qui istoc animo sies,
Ego sentio.

Ah pergisne?

Jam jam desino.

I ergo intro, cui rei opus est,
Ei rei hilarem hunc sumamus diem.

NEver was there any man so well advised with himself how to live,
But things, age, and practice, may always afford him some new thing,
May teach him somewhat, so that you do not know those things which you think
you do know,
And after you have made trial you reject those things which you made most
choice of:

The race of my life being now almost run out; wherefore have I done it? I have
found in very deed
That nothing is better for a man then gentleness and clemency.
That that is true, it is an easy thing for any man that will to know by me
and my brother.
He always led his life at ease, in eating good cheer,

He lived to himself, he bestowed cost on himself; all men spake well of him,
they love him.
I that countrie-low^, that am testy, dumpish, niggardlie, feirce-look't,
pinching,
Married a wife; what misery therein have I seen? I had sons born me,
This was another care; and moreover whilst I take care to do for them

Now my years being spent, I reap this benefit from them for my labour,
Their hatred: that other enjoys all the commodities a father should do
without any pains.
They love him; they fly from me; they trust him with all their secrets;
They like him; they are both with him; I am forsaken.

Forsooth, thus hath he made his with a little cost, those that I have brought
up
With a great deal of labour; I get all the misery, and he enjoys
The pleasure. Well, well, let us now try what I can do contrary to these
things,
To speak fair and deal lovinglie, seeing he provokes me to it;

If that be done by giving, and following them in their wills, I will not be
inferior to any man.
There will be a want. That makes nothing to me, who am the elder brother.

NUnquam ita quisquam been subducta ratione ad vitam fuit,
Quin res, aetas, usus semper aliquid apporter novi,
Aliquid moneat, ut illa, quae te scire credas, nescias;
Et quae tibi putaris prima, in experiundo ut repudies:

Proper jam excurso spatio, mitto; id quamobrem? re ipsa repperi
Facilitate nihil esse la melius, neque clementia.
Id esse veunm; ex me atque ex fratre, cuivis facile est noscere.
Ille suam semper egit vitam in otio, in conviv^s,

Sibi vixit, sibi sumptum fecit; omnes benedicere, amant.
Ego ille agrestis, saevus, tristis, parcus, truculentus, tenax,
D^xi uxorem; quam ibi miseriam vidi? nati ^lii,
^ cura: porro autem dum studeo illis ut quam ^urimum
^ Facerem, contrivi in quaerendo vitam, atque aetatem ^am.
M^c exacta aetate hoc fructi pro labore ab his fero,
Odium; ille alter sine labore patria potitur commoda;
Illum amant, me fugitant: illi credunt consilia sua;
Illum diligunt: apud illum sunt ambo: ego desertus sum.

Scilicet, ita eos eductos meo labore maxumo, hic fecit la
Paulo sumptu; miseriam omnem ego capio, hic potitur
Gaudia, Age, age, nunc experiamur contra haec quid ego possiem
Blande dicere, aut benig^e facere, quando eo provocat.

Si id fit dando atque obsequendo, non posteriores feram.
Deerit. Id mea minin^e refert, qui sum natu maximus.

Ho Demea, your brother entreats you would not go too far.

What fellow is that? O my Syrus; good morrow: how do you? how goes all?

All well.

That is very well; I have just now for the first point added these three
things
Contrary to my nature. O my, how do you? how goes all?
You show your self to be an honest servant, and I will do you a good turn,
Syrus,
With all my heart.

I thank you.

But, Syrus,
This is true, and you shall find it so indeed after a short time.

HEus Demea, rogat f^ater no abe^s long ut.

Quis homo est? O Sire noster, salve; quid agitur?

Recte.

Optime est; jam nunc haec (...) primum addidi,
Praeter naturam. O noster, quid fit? quid agitur?
Sire,
Lubens been faxim.

Gratiam habeo.

Atqui, Sire,
Hoc verum est, ipsa re experiere propediem.

Mistress, I will go hence to these men and see, how soon they will fetch
The maid. But see yonder is Demea, good morrow.

Oh what is your name?

Geta.

Geta, in my mind I have judged you
To day to be a man of much worth;

That hath a care of his master, as I see you have, Geta;
And I will be ready with all my heart to do you a good turn,
If occasion be offered. I'll try how courteous I can be,
And it goes on well.

You are an honest man, seeing you think these things of me.



HEra, ego hinc ad hos provisam, quam mox virginem
Accersant. Sed eccum Demeam, salvus sies.

Oh, qui vocare?

Geta.

Geta, hominem maximi
Pretii esse te body judicavi animo meo;

Cui dominus curae est, ita ut tibi sensi, Geta,
Et tibi ob eam rem, si quid usus venerit,
Lubens been faxim. Meditor esse affabilis,
Et benc procedit.

Bonus es, cum haec existimas.


THey kill me indeed, whilst they strive to make the marriage
Too Ceremonious, they spend the whole day in getting things ready.

Aeschinus, how goes all?

O my father, was you here?

Truly thine own father indeed, both in affection and nature,

Why do you not fetch your wife home?

I desire it, but this thing hinders me,
The musician, and they that sing the wedding-song.

What will you
Stand to hearken to this old man?

What?

Let these things alone,
The company, the marriage-song, the lights, the musicians,

As soon as can be, fetch over this way, make but one house;
Bring over both the mother and all the family to our house.

Content,
Most pleasant father.

O brave, now I am called a pleasant man.
My brother's house shall have a thorow-fair, he will bring a company

I the pleasant man begin to grow into favour; bid Babylo just now
To tell out twenty pounds.
Syrus, do you make no haste to go and do it?

What then?

Pull it down.
Do you go, and bring them over.

A blessing on you, Demea,

To have it dispatcht for our family.

I think they deserve it.
What say you?

I think so.

It is a great deal better,
Then for that child-bed woman to be now brought this way along the street
Being so green as she is.

Truly my father, I never saw any thing better done.
Mitio comes out of doors.

OCccidunt me quidem, dum nimis sanctas nuptias
Student facere, in apparando totum consumunt diem.

Quid agitur, Aeschine?

Ehem pater mi, tun' hic eras?

Tuus hercle vero, animo, natura, pater,

Uxorem, quaeso, accersis?

Cupio: verum hoc mihi morae est;
Tibicina, qui Hymenaeum cantent.

Eho; vin'tu
Huic seni auscultare?

Quid?

Missa haec face.
Turbam, Hymenaeum, lampadas, tibicinas,

Quantum potest, hac transfer, unam fac familiam;
Traduce matrem familiam omnem ad nos.

Placet,
Pater lepidissime.

Euge, jam lepidus vocor.
Fratris aedes fient perviae; turbam domum

Ego lepidus ineo gratiam; jube nunc jam
Dinumeret ille Babylo viginti minas.
Sire, cessas ire ac facere?

Quid ergo?

Dirue
Tu illas, abi, traduce.

Dii tibi, Demea,

Tam ex animo factum velle.

Dignos arbitror.
Tu quid ais?

Sic opinor.

Multo rectius est,
Quam illam puerperam hac nunc duci per viam
Aegrotam.

Nihil melius vidi, pater mi.
Mitio egreditur for as.

DOth my brother command this? where is he? Do you command thus, Demea?

I indeed command both in this matter, and in all other things,
That we may make this family as much as can be one with ours,
That we may respect, help, and join it to us.

I pray you, let it be so, father.



Yea indeed it becomes us to do so.
First, she is the mother of his wife.

What then?

An honest and modest woman.

So they say.

Somewhat ancient in years.

I know it.

She is long since past having children by reason of her years,
Neither is there any body that regards her, she is a lonely woman.

What doth he mean to do?



What me to marry?

You.

Me?

You I say.

You play the fool.

If you be a man, get him to do it.

My father.

What, you ass, do you hearken to him?

You had as good do nothing.
It cannot be done otherwise.

You d^a^.

Let me over-intreat you,


Are you mad? take him away.

Come on, give way,
I pray you, to your son.

Are you sufficiently in your wit? Should I n^w at length
Become a new-married man in the threescore and fifth year of my age, and
marry
A decr^pit old woman? Do ye advise me to that?

Do it:
I have promised them.

And have you promised them? Be liberal of your own s^wcie boy.



As if this were not
The greatest of all.

Give him his asking.

Do not think much at it.

Do it, promise.

Do not you let me alone?

No, except I may over-intreat you.

Truly this is a kind of forcement.

Come on, do freely, Mitio.

Although this seem to me to (...) nought, foolish,
Absurd, and far from my course of life, yet if you


You do well;
I love you accordingly as you deserve.

But what? what should say? seeing this is done,
Which I desire. What is now behind^? Hegio is n^x^ kinsman to thes^
Of af^nitie to us, a poor-man; it bec^mmeth us to do him
Some good turn.

To do what?

Here is a little close
Near the city, which you rent forth; let us give it him,
That he may enjoy it.

And but a little one?

If it were a great one,
We must do it; he is as a father to her, he is a good man, it is well
bestowed.
Lastly, I do not make any word mine, Mitio, which you spake
Erewhile well and wisely. It is a common fault of us all,

We ought to avoid this blemish,
It was truly said, and it ought to be done in good earnest.

What is that? it shall be bestowed on him indeed, seeing this man will have it
so.

My father.

Now you are mine own full brother both in soul


I am glad of it.

I convince him with his own argument.

JUbet frater? ubi is est? tune jubes hoc, Demea?

Ego vero jubeo, hac re, aliis omnibus
Quam maxim unam facere nos hanc familia^;
Colere, adjuvare, adju^gere.

Ita quaeso, pater.



Imo hercle ita nobis decet.
Primum hujus uxoris est matter.

Quid postea?

Proba modesta.

Ita aiunt.

Natu grandior.

Scio.

Parere jam diu per annos non potest:
Nec, qui eam respiciat, quisquam est; sola est.

Q^am rem hic agit?



Me ducere autem?

Te.

Me?

Te, inquam.

Ineptis.

Si tu sis homo, hic fa^i^t.

Mi pater.

Quid tu huic, asine, auscultas?

Nihil agis.
Fi^ri aliter non pot^st.

Deliras.

Sine


Insanis? aufer.

Age, da veniam,
Quaeso, filio.

Sati^' sa^us es? Ego novus maritus
Anno demum quinto sex^g^simo fiam, atque anum
Decrepitam duca^? ^dne estis au^ores mihi!

Fac.
Promisi ego illis.

Promisisti autem? de te largitor, puer,



Quasi hoc non sit
Maxumum?

Da veniam.

No gravere.

Fac, promitte.

Non omittis?

Non nisi te exorem.

Vis haec quidem est.

Age, age prolix, Mitio.

Etsi hoc mihi pravu^, ineptum,
Absurdum, atque alienum a vita m^a videtur; si vos


Been facis;
Merito te amo.

Verum quid? quid ego dicam? hoc cum fit
Quod volo. Quid (...) restat? Hegio est cognatus
Proximus, affinis nobis, pauper; been nos aliquid
Facere illi dec^t.

Quid facere?

Agelli hic
Sub ^rbe paululum, quod locitas for as; huic demus
Qui fruatur.

Paululum autem?

Si multum siet,
Faciundum est: pro patre huic est, bonus est, recte datur.
Postremo, non meum ullum verbum facio, quod tu, Mitio,
Be^e sapienter dixti dudum: Vitium commune

Sumus: Hanc maculam nos decet effugere:
Dictum est vere, re ipsa fieri oportet.

Quid istuc? dabitur quidem quando hic vult.

Mi pater.

Nunc tu mihi germanus pariter animo


Gaudeo.

Suo sibi gladio hunc jugulo.

WHat you commanded is done, Demea.

You are a thrifty honest man.
Therefore in my opinion I verily judge it meet,
That Syrus should be made free to day.

That fellow free? for what doing?

Many good things.

O our Demea,

Those your sons for you continually ever since they were children.
I have taught them, and advised, and always given them all the good
instructions
That ever I was able.

The de^d bears mention; and indeed moreover,
These things, to play the caterer, to bring you a where with a viol,


O merry man!

Lastly, this man was a helper to day
In buying that singing-wench, he looked to it, it is fit that we d^e him a
good turn,
Other servants will be the better; to conclude, he will have it so done.

Will you
Have this done.

I desire so.

Seeing you will have this thing; h^ Syrus,


You do well; I do thank you all,
And especially you Demea, besides.

I am glad of it.

And so am I.

I believe it* I wish this joy
May be long-lasting; O that I might see my wife Phrygia
Set at liberty with me.

A very good woman indeed.

And truly


Indeed in earnest, seeing she was the first woman
That gave him suck, there is no doubt, but itis reason she should be set free.

For that matter?

For that; lastly, take as much money of me
As she is worth.

I pray God grant you all things that you desire Demea.

Syrus, you have made a good days work of it to day.

And if you, Mitio,
Besides will do your duty, and give him a little afore-hand,
That he may make use of, he will give it you again
Shortly.

Not this much worth

He is an honest thrifite man.

I will repay you
Truly. Do but give it me.

Do, father.

I will consider hereafter.



O the best man in all the world.

O most pleasant father.

What is the matter? what thing hath so suddenly changed your manners?
O Demea, what wastful spending? what sudden largio^ snesse is this?

I will tell you. That I might show you that, for which they account you
A gentle pleasant man; that that is not done by a serious course of ^fe,

And giving them their wills, freely bestowing on them, Mitio. And now
Aeschinus, if for that matter my life be so hateful to you,
Because I let you nothave your mind altogether in all those unjust things,
I set the cart on wheels; waste, throw away,

What you do not so well see because of your youth,
What you more earnestly desire, and little consider,
That I should find fault with and redress these things,
And humour you when occasion serves; lo I am here that will do it for you.


To be done. But what shall be done concerning my brother?

I permit him,
Let him have her; let him make an end (of his wenching) in (having) her.

That is well said. Clap hands for joy.

FActum est quod jussisti, Demea.

Frugi homo es.
Ergo aedipol body mea quidem sententia
Judico, Syrum fieri, esse aequum, liberum.

Istunc liberum? quodnam ob factum?

Multa.

O n^ster Demea,

Ambos sedulo; docui, monui, been praecepi semper
Quae potui omnia.

Res apparet; quidem porro
Haec, obsona^e, cum fide scortum adducere, apparare


O lepidum caput!

Postremo body in psaltria istac
Emunda, hic adjutor fuit, hic curavit: prodesse aequum est:
Alii meliores ^runt; denique, hic vult fieri.

Vin' tu hoc
Fieri.

Cupio.

Siquidem tu vis hoc; ^ho Sire,
Accede huc ad me, liber esto.

Been facis, omnibus
Demea.

Gaudeo.

Et ego.

Credo; utinam hoc perpetuum
Fiat gaudium, Phrygiam uxorem meam una videam
Liberam.

Optimam quidem mulierem.

Et quidem
Tuo nepoti hujus filio, body primam mammam


Hercle vero serio, siquidem prima
Dedit, haud dubium est, quin emitti aequum siet:

Ob eam rem?

Ob eam. Postremo, a me argentum, quanti est,
Sumito.

Dii tibi, Demea omnes semper optata omnia
Offerant.

Sire, processisti body pulchre.

Siquidem
Mitio, tuum officium facies, atque huic aliquid
Paululum prae manu dederis, unde utatur, reddet tibi
Cito.

Istoc vilius.

Frugi homo est.

Reddam
Hercle. Da modo.

Age, pater.

Post consulam.

Facies.

O vir optime.

O pater festivissime.


O Demea quod proluvium? quae ista subita est largitas?

Dicam tibi. Ut id ostenderem, quod te isti facilem
Et festivum putant; id non fieri ^x vera vita,
Neque adeo ex aequo bono, sed ex assentando,
Mitio; nunc adeo
Si ob eam rem vobis mea vita invisa est, Aeschine,
Quia non ista injusta prorsus omnia omnino
Obsequor, missa facio, effundite, emittite,
Facite quod vobis lubet. Sed si id vultis potius,

Magis impense cupitis, consulitis parum,
Haec reprehendere, corrigere me,
Obsecundare in loco; ecce me, qui faciam vobis.

Tibi pater permittimus: plus scis quid opus


Sino,
Habeat, in istac finem faciat.

Istuc recte.
Plaudi^e.
