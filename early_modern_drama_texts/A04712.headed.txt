INterpone tuis interdum gaudia curis
Ut possis animo quemues sufferre laborem
Do any of you know what latin is this
Or ells wold you have, an expositor^m
To declare it in Englyshe, per sensum planiorem
It is b^st I speak Englyshe, or ells with in a whylle
I may percace mine own self, with my latin beguile.
The two verses, which I rehersid before
I find writt^n, in the book of Cato the wise
Emongs good precepts, of living a thousand more
Which to follow there, he doth all men auise
And they may be Englyshed, breflie in this wise
Emongs thy carful business, use sum time mirth joy
That no bodily work, thy wits break or noye.
For the mind (saith he) in serious matters occupied
If it have not sum quiet mirth, and recreation
Interchangeable admixed, must niddes be soon wearied
And (as who should say) tried, through continual operation
Of labour and business, without relaxacion
Therefore intermix honest mirth, in such wise
That your streght may be refreshid, to labours suffis^
For as meat and drink, natural rest and sleep
For the cons^ruacion, and hel^h of the body
Must niddes be had, so the mind and wits to keep
Pregnant, fresh industruis, quike and instie
Honest mirth, and pastime, is requisite and necessary
For, Quod caret alterna re quie du^ abile non est
Nothing may endure (saith Ouyd) with out sum rest.
Example, proof her of in earth is well found
Manifest open and verie^ evident
For except the husbandman suffer his ground
Sum times to rest, it wol bear no fruit verament
Therefore they let the filed lye, every second year
To the end that after rest, it may the better corn bear.
Thus than (as I have said) it is a thing natural
And naturally belonging to all living creatures
And unto man especially, above others all
To have at times coueniet pastauce, mirth, pleasurs
So they be joined with honesty, keapt with in due measurs
And the same well allowed not only the said Cato
But also ye Pyilosophers, Plutarke, Socrates Plato
And Cicero Tullius, a man sapient and wise
wills the same, in that his first book
W^ich he wrote, and e^tytulid, of an honest mans office
Who so is disposid thereupon to look
Where to def^e, and offirme, he boldly on him took
That to here Enterluds, is pastim^ convenient
For all manner men, and a thing congruent.
He rekeneth that namely, as a very honest disport
And above al other things, commends ye old comedy
The hearing of which, may do the mind c^mfort
For they be replenished with precepts of Philosophie
The contain much wisdom teach prudet pollecie
and though they be al write of mattiers of non iportauce
Yet the show great wit, and much pretty conu^iaunce.
And in this manner of making, Plautus did ^xcell
As records the same Tullius commending him bi name
Wherefore this maker deliteth passinglye well
Too follow his arguments, and draw out the same
For to make at seasuns cou^niet pastims mirth game
As now he hath do this matter not worth an oyster shell
Except percace it shall furtune too make you laugh well
And for that purpose only this maker did it write
Taking the ground thereof out of Plautus first comedy
And the fi^st scentence of ye same for higher things endite
In no wise he wold, for yet the time is so ques^e
That he that speaks best, is lest thank worthy
Therefore, since noting but trifles may be had
you shall here a thing yt only shall make you merry glad.
And such a trifling matter as when it shall be done
Ye may report and say ye have heard nothing at all
Therefore I tell you all, before it be begone
That no man look to hear of matters substancyall
Nor mattiers of any grauitee either great or small
For this mak^r showed us that such manner things
Do never well besime little boys handelinges.
wherefore if ye will not sowrelie your broues bend
At such a fantastical conceit as this
But can be content to hear and see the end
I woll go show the Players what your pleasure is
Which to wait upon you I know be ready or this
I woll goo send them hither in too your presence
Desiring that they may have quiet audience.

OUr lord of Heaven and sweet saint Ihone
Rest you merry my maist^rs euerychone
And I pray to Christ and sweet saint Steu^n
Send you all many a good euine
And you to sir, and you, and you also
Good euine to you an hundred times a thousand mo
Now by all these crosses of flesh bone and blod
I reckine my chance right maruaylus good
Here now to find all this company
Which in my mind I wished for hartylie
For I have laboured all day till I am weary
And now am disposed too pass the time, and be merry
And I think noon of you, but he would do the same
For who wol be sad, and nedithe not, is ^o^le to blame
And as for me, of my mother I have bin tought
To be merry when I may, and take no thought
Which leasone, I bare so well away
That I use to make merry oons a day
And now if all things happyn right
You shall see as mad a pastime this night
As you saw this seven years? and as propre a joy
As ever yon saw played of a toy
I am called Iake Juggler, of many an oon
And in faith I woll play a juggling cast a non
I woll cunger the moull, and god before
Or else leat me l^se my name for evermore
I have it devised, and compas^ed thou
And what ways, I woll tell and show to you
you all know well Master Boungrace
The gentleman that dwellith here in this place
And Ienkine Carreawaie, his page as cursed a lad
And as ungracious as ever man had
An unhappy wage, as foolish a knave with al
As any is now, within London wall
This Ienkine and I been fallen at great debate
For a mattier, that fell betwine us a late
And hitherto of him I could never revenged be
For his master mantaineth hi, loves not me
Albe it the very truth to tell
Another of the both, knows me not very well
But against al other boys, the said gentle man
Maynteyneth him, all that he can
But I shall set little by my wit
If I do not Ienkine this night requite
Ere I sleep Ienkine shall be mete
And I trust to cume partly out of his dete
And when we mete again, if this do not suff^e
I shall paye Ienkine the residue, in my best wise
It chased me right now in the other end of ye n^xt street
With Ienkine and his master, in the face to met
I aboed there a whylle, playng for to see
At the Buklers, as welbe commed m^e
It was not lunge time, but at the last
Bake cumithe my cos^ne Careawaie, homward full fast
Pricking, Praunsing, and springynge in his short cote
And pleasantly synginge, with a merry note
Wither a way so fast, tarry a while said oon
I cannot now said Ienkine, I must nides be goon
My master sups herbye, at a gentylmans place
And I must thither feache my dame, masters bougrace
But yet er I go, I care not motche
At the bukelers to play, with thee oon fair toche
To it they went, and played so long
Till Ienkine thought he had wrong
By cokes prceious potstike, I will not home this night
Quod he, but as good a stripe oon thie head light
Within half an hour, or sum what less
Ienkine left playng, and went to featche his maisteris
But by the way he met with a Freuteres wife
There Ienkine and she fell at such strife
For snatching of an Apple, that down he cast
Her basket, and gatherid up the apples fast^
And put them in his sleue, the came he his way
By an other lane, as fast as he may
till he came at a corner, by a shoops stall
Where boys were at Dice, faring at all
When Careawaie with that good company met
He fell to faring, withouten let
Forgetting his message, and so well did he fare
that when I came ^ye, he began swear and stare
And full bitt^rlye, began to curse
As oone that had lost, almost all in his purse
For I know his old gise, and condition
Never to leave, till all his money be goon
For he hath no money, but what he doth stell
And that woll he play, a way every dell^
I passed by, and then called unto my mind
Sartayde old rekeaninges, that were behind
Bitwen Ienkine me, who partly to recompense
I trust by gods grace, ^re I goo hence
This garments, cape, and all other geare^
That now you see, upon me here
I have done oon, all like unto his
For the nons, and my purpose is
To make Ienkine, byliue if I can
That he is not him self, but an other man
For except he hath better loke, than he had
He woll cum hither, stark staring mad
When he shall cum, I wol handle my captine so
Than he shall not well wot, whether too goo
His Maisteris I know, she w^ll him blame
And his Master also, will do the same
Because that she, of her supper deceived is
For I am sure they have all supped by this
But and if Ienkine, wold hither resort
I trust he and I, should make sum sport
If I had sooner spokine, he wold have sooner been here
For my simithe, I do his voice hear.

A sir I may say, I have been at a fest
I have lost.ii. s^and sir pence at the ^est
Mary sir, of this gains I nyde make no bost
But the devil goo with all, more have I lost
My name is Careawaie, let all sorrow pass
I woll ere too morrow night be as rich as ever I was
Or at ye forthest within a day or twain
Me Masters purst, shall paye me again
Therefore hogh careawaie, now wol I sig^ hei he^
But bi ye lord now I remember a another thing
By my faith Ienkine my Maisteris and thou
At like to gre, god knows thou
That thou come not, for her incontinent
To bring her to supper, when thou were sent
And now they have all supped, thou wolt shurlie aby
Except thou imagine, sumpretie and crafty lye
For she is as all other women be
A very cursed shrew, by the blessid Trinity.
And a very Devil, for if she oons begyne
To fight, or chide, in a weke she wol not lyne
And a great pleasure she hath, specyally now of late
To get poor men, now and then by the pate
For she is an angry piece of flesh, and soon displeasyd
Quikely moved, but not lightly appesed
We use to call her at home, dame Coy
A pretty gingerlie pice, god save her and saint Loye
As denty and nice, as an halpeny worth of silver spoons
But vengeable melancholy, in the after noons
She uses for her bodylie health, and safe guard
To chid daily oone fit, too supperward
And my Master himself, is worse then she
If he ons thoroughly angeryd be
And a maid we have at home, Aulsoon tripe and goo
Not all London can ^hewe, such oth^r two
She simperith, she prankith and gets with out faylle
As a peacock that hath spread, and shows her gay tail
Se minceth, she brideleth, she swims to and fro
She tredith not one here a wry, she tryppeth like a do
A broad in the street, going or cumming homward
She quauerith, and ward^lith, like one in a galliard
Every joint in her body and every part
Oh it is a ioylie wench to myns and deuyd a fart
She talks, she chatteth like a Pie all day
And speaks like a parat Poppagaye
And that as fine, as a small silken thread
Ye and as high as an Eagle can fl for a neade
But it is a spitfull lying girl, and never well
But when she may sum ill ta^l by me tel
She woll I warrant you, a non at the first
Of me imagine, and say the worst.
And what soever she to my maisteris doth say
It is written in the gosspell of the same day
Therefore I woll here with my self devise
What I may best say, and in what wise
I may excuse this my long taryeng
That she of my negligence may suspect n^thyng
For if the fault of this be found in me
I may give my life for halpenis three
Hic cogitab^ndo similis sedeat.
Let me ^lodie this month, and I shall not fiend
A b^lt^r devise then now is cume to my mind
Maistries woll I say, I am bound by my duty
To see that your womanhod have no injury
For I hear and see, more then you now and then
And your self partly know the want in wiles of men
When we came yender, there did I see
My master kiss gentlewomen tow or three
And to come emongs others my thought bysye
He had a myruayllus great fantasy
A non he commaundyd me to run thens for you
To cume supe there if you wold but I wot not how
My hart grudgid mistrusting lest that I being away
My master wold sum light cast play
Where upon maistries, to se the end
I tarried half supper time so god me mend
And besides that there was such other compainye
As I know your maistrisship sets nothing by
Gorges deigns of the corte and galaunts also
with doctors, and other rufflers mo
At last when I thought it time and seasune
I cam too certify you as it was reasune
And by the way whom should I mete
But that most honest Gentleman in the street
Which the last wike was with you here
And made you a banquet, and bouncing cheer
Ah Ienkin {quod} he good spid how fare thou
Mary well god yld it you m^ster {quod} I how do you
How doth thy maisteris is she at home
Ye sir {quod} I and sups all a lone
And but she hath no manner good chere
I am sure she wold gladly have you there
I cannot cum now said he I have business
But thou shalt carry a tokine from me to thy maistreis
Goo with me too my chaumbre at yone lane end
And I woll a dish of costerds unto her send
I folowid him, and was bold by your leave
To receive and bring them here in my sleue
But I wold not for all Englond by Ihesu Christ
That my master Boungrace hereof wit
Or knew that I should any such gear to you bring
Lest he misdeme us both in sum worse thing
Nor show him nothing of that I before said
For then in did sir I am arrayed
If you do I may nothing herafter unto you tell
whether I se mi master do ill or well
That if you now this counsel keep
I wol ease you parchaunce twice in a wike
you may say you were sike and your head did ache
that you lu^ed not ^his night any supper make
Specially with out the doors but thought it best
too abide at home and take your rest
And I will to my master too bring him home
For you know he wolbe angry if he come alone
this most I say and fa^e it so well
That she shall believe it every dell
Thou say you friends, by the arms of Robyn hood
Wol not this excuse be reasonable good
To muse for any beeter, great folly it is
For I may make sure reke^ning of this
That and if I wold sit sto^ing this.vii. year
I shall not ells find how to save me all clear
And as you see ^or the most part our wits be best
When we be takyne most vnrediest
But I wol not give for that boy a fly
That hath not al times in store one good lye
And cannot set a good face upon the same
Therefore saint Gorge y^ boroue, as it wol let him frame
I woll ieopard a joint, be^ as be may
I have had many like chances, before this day
But I promise you I do curstlie fear
For I feel a vengeable burning in my left ere
And it hath bin a saying, of time long
That sweet mete woll have sour sauce among
And surely I shall have sum ill hape
For my here standith up under my cape
I would knock but I dare not by our lady
I fear hanging where unto no man is hasty
But seeing there is no another remedy
Thus to stand any longer it is but folly.
Hic pulset ostium.
They be so far with in, the cannot hear

Soft thy knoking saucy knave, what make thou there

What knave is that? he speaks not too me I trow
And we mete the one of us is like to have a blow
For now that I am well chafed, and somewhat hot
twenty such could I hew as small as flesh to rote
And surly if I had a knife
This knave should escape hardily with his life
To teach him to ask of me any more
What I make at my own maistirs door

But if thou come from that gate thou knave
I woll fet thee by the sweat looks so god me save

Woll the horesoon fight in dede by mine honesty
I know no quarrel he hath too me
But I wold I were with in the house
And then I wold not set by him a louse
For I fear and mistrust such quareling thiues
See how he beginnith to strike up his fleues

His arse makith buttens now, and who lustith to feale
Shall find his hart creping out at his heel
Or ells lying hiden in sum corner of his hose
If it be not already dropped out of his nose
For as I doubt not but you have hard beforne
A more dastard covered knave was never borne

The devil set the house a fire, I trow it is a cursed
When a man ^ath most hast he spedith worst
If I be robed, or slain, or any harm geate
The fault is in them that doth not me in let
And I durst ieoperd, an hunderid pound
That sum bauderie might now within be found
But except sum of them come the sooner
I shall knock such a peal, that al englond shall wo^er

Knoke at the gate hardily again if thou dare
And seeing thou wolt not bye fair words beware
Now fistes, me thinks yesterday.vii. years past
That four men a sleep at my fete you cast
And this same day you did no manner good
Nor were not washen in warm blod

What whoreson is this that washith in warm blod
Sum devil broken loose, out of hell for wood
Four hath he slain, and now well I see
That it must be my chance the fifth to be
But rather then thus shamfullye too be slain
wold Christ my friends had hanged me being but years.ii
And yet if I take good hart and be bold
Percace he wolbe more sobre and could

Now hands bestur you about his lyppes and face
And streak out all hi^ teeth without any grace
Gentelma^ are you disposed to ear any fist mete

I have supped I thank you sir and list not to eat
Give it to them that are haungrie if you be wise

Yet shall do a man of your d^et no harm to sup twice
This shall be your Chise, to make your merdigest
For I tell you these hands weighith of the best

I shall never escape see how he waghith his hands

with a stroke they will lay a (...) in our lady b^an^
And this day yet they have done no g^d at all

Ere you assay the on me, I pray thee lame the on ye wall
But speak you all this in earnest, or in game
If yo^ be angry with me truly you are to blame
For have you any just quarrel to me

Eer thou and I part that wol I show thee

Or have I done you any manner displeasure

Ere thou and I part thou shalt know, y^ may besure

By my faith if thou be angry without a cause
You shall have a mends made with a cople of straus
By thee I set what soever thou art
But for thy displeasure I care not a fart
May a man demand whose servant you be

My masters seruaunt I am for verity

what busynes have you at this place now

Nay mary tell me what busynes hast thou
For I am commanded for to watch give diligence
That in my good master Boungraces absence
No misfortune may happen to his house certain

well now I am cume, you may go hens again
And thank them yt so much for my master hath done
Sewing them yt the servants of y^ house be cume home
For I am of the house, and now in woll I goo

I cannot tell whether thou be of the house or no
But goo no ne'er, lest I handle thee like a stranger
Thank no man but thy self, if thou be in any danger

Mary I defy thee, and planly unto thee tell
That I am a seruaunt of this house, and here I dwell

Now so god me snache, but thou goo thee ways
Whille thou may, for this forty d^yes
I ^hall make thee not able to goo nor ride
But in a dungcart or a whilberow lying on on side

I am a seruaunt of this house by these.x. bons

No more prating but geat thee hens at towns

Why my master hath sent me home in his message

Pike and walk a knave, here a way is no passage

What wilt thou let me from my nowne maistirs house

Be tredging, or in faith you ^ere me a souse
Here my master and I have our habitation
A^d hath continually dwelled in this mansyon
At the least this doos^n years and od
And here wol we end our lives by the grace of god

Why then where shall my master and I dwell

At the Devil if you lust, I can not tell

In nomine patris, now this gear doth pass
For a little before supper here our house was
And this day in ye morning I wol on a book swer
That my master and I both dwelleyd here

Who is thy master tell me with out lye
And thine own name also let me know shortly
For my masters all, let me have the blame
If this knave kno his master or his own name

My masters name is master Boungrace
I have dwelled with him a lunge space
And I am ienkin Careawaye his page

What ye drunkin knave begin you to rage
Take that, art thou master Boungracis page

If I be not, I have made a very good viage

Dare thou too my face say thou art I

I would it were true and no lye
For then thou should smart, and I should bet
Where as now I do all the blows get

And is master Boungrace thy master doest y^ ^hen say

I woll swear on a book, he was ons this day

And for that thou shalt sum what have
Beca^se thou presume, like a saucy lying knave
To say my master is thine? who is thy master now?

By my truth sir who so ever please you
I am your own, for you beat me so
As no man but my master should do

I woll handle thee better if faut be not in fist

Help save my life masters for ye passion of christ

Why thou lowsy thief doest thou cry and rare

No faith I woll not cry one whit more
Save my life help, or I am slain

Ye doest thou make a romeringe yet a gain
Did not I bide the hold thy peace

In faith now I leave crieng, now I seas help, help,

Who is thy master

Master Boungrace

I woll make the change ye song, ere we pas this place
For he is my master, and a gain to see I say
That I am his ienkin Careawaye
Who art thou now tell me plain

No body, but whom please you certain

Thou saydest even now thy name was Careawaie

I cry you marcy sir, and forgiveness pray
I said a miss because it was so too day
And thought it should have continued always
Like a foal as I am and a drunken knave
But in faith sir ye se all the wit I have
Therefore I beseech you do me no more blame
But give me a new master, and an other name
For it wold grieve my hart so help me god
To run about the streets like a maisterlis nod

I am he that thou saydest thou were
And master boungrace is my master yt dweleth hear
thou art no point Careawaye thy wits do thee faylle

Ye mary sir you have bett them down into my taylle
But sir might I be bold to say on thing
Without any bloues, and without any beatynge

Truce for a while say one what thy lust

May a man too your honest by your word trust
I pray you swear by the mass you woll do me no ill

By my faith I promise pardon thee I woll

What and you keep no promise. In juggler, then upon ca^
I pray god light as much or more as hath on y^ to day

Now dare I speak so mote I thee
Master boungrace is my master, and the name of me
is ienken careaway, jack juggler. What says thou so

And if thou wilt strike me, and break thy promise, do
And beat on me, till I stink, and till I dye
And yet woll I still say that I am I

This bedlam knave without dought is mad

No by god for all that I am a wise lad
And can cale to remembrance every thing
That I did this day, sith my vprisynge
For went not I with my master to day
Early in the morning to the Tenis play?
At noone while my master at his dinner sate
Played not I at Dice at the gentylmans gate
Did not I wait on my master to supper ward
And I thike I was not changed y^ way howard
Or ells if thou think I lye
Ask in the street of them that I came bye
And since that I cam hither into your presens
what man living could carry me hens
I remember I was sent to fetch my maisteris
And what I devised to save me harmeles
Do not I speak now is not this my hand
Be not these my feet yt on this ground stand?
Did not this other knave her knoke me about ye heed?
And beat me till I was almost dede?
How may it then be, that he should be I?
Or I not my self it is a shamfull lye
I woll home to our house, whosoever say nay
For surely my name is ienkin Careawaye

I wol make thee say otherwise ere we depart if we can

Nay that woll I not in faith for no man
Except thou tell me what I thou hast done
Ever sith five of the cloak this after noon:
Rehearse me all that with out any lye
And then I woll confess that thou art I

When my master came to the gentylmas place
He commanded me too rune home a great pace
Too fet thither my maisteris and by the way
I did a good while at the bukelers play
Then came I by a wife that did costerds sell
And cast down her basket fair and well
And gathered as many as I could get
And put them in my sleue here they be yet

How the devil should they cume there
For I did them all in my own sleue bear
He l^eth not a word in all this
Nor doth in any one point myse
For ought I se yet between ernest and game
I must go sike me a another name
But thou might see al this, tel the rest that is behind
And there I know I shall thee a liar find

I ran thence homeward a contrary way
And wheth^r I stopped there or nay
I could tell if me lusts a good token
But it may not very well be spoken

No may I pray thee let no man that here
But tell it me priuelye in mine ere

I thou lost all thy money at dice christ give it his curse
well and truly pycked before out of an other mas p^rse

Gods body horeson thief who told thee that same
Sum cunning devil is with in thee payne of shame
In nomine patris, god and our blessed lady
Now and evermore save me from thy cumpanye

How now art thou Careawaye or not

By the lord I doubt, but say thou nay to that

Ye mary I tell thee care away is my name

And by these ten bones mine is the same
Or ells tell me if I be not he
What my name frome hensforth shall be

By my faith the same that it was before
When I lust too be Careawaye no more
Look well upon me, and thou shalt see as now
That I am ienkyne Careawaye and not thou
Look well a upon me, and by every thing
Thou shalt well know that I make no leasing.

I se it is so without any doubt
But how the devil came it a bout
W^o so in England lokethe on him stedelye
Sall perceive plainly that he is I
I have scene my self a thousand times in a glass
But so like myself as he is never was
He hath in every point my clothing mi gear
My head, my cape, my shirt and notted hear
And of the same colour, my yes, nose and lyppes
Much ^ nea^e, feet, leges, and hippes
Of the same statute, and hight and age
And is in every point master Boungrace page
That if he have a hole in his tail
He is even I mine own self without any fail
And yet when I remember I wot not how
The same ma yt I have ever bine me thinkith I am now
I know mi master, his house, my five wits I have
Why then should I give credence to this foolish knave
That nothing entendith but me delude and mooke
For whom should I fear at my masters gate to knoke

Think t^ou I have said all this in game
Goo or I shall send the hens in the dyuills name
A void thou lousye lurden precious stinking slave
that n^ther thy name know nor can any master have
wine shakin, pilorye peepours, of lice not without a peck
Hens or by gods precious I shall break thy neck

Then master I besiche you hartylye take the payne
If I be found in any place too bring me to me again
Now is not this a wonderful case
That no man should lease him self so in any place
Have any of you harde of such a thing here to fore
No nor never shall I dare say from hensforth any more

while he muses an judges him self upon
I wo^l steal a way for a while and let him a loon

Good lord of heuine, where did I my self leave
Or who did me of my name by the way bereave
For I am sure of this in my mind
That I did in no place leave my self byhinde
If I had my name played a way at dice
Or had sold my self to any man at a price
Or had made a fray and had lost it in fighting
Or it had byne stolen from me sleaping
It had byne a matter and I wold have kept patience
But it spiteth my hart to have lost it by such open negligence
Ah thou horesone drowsy drunken sot
Yt were an alms died to walk thy cote
And I shrew him that wold for thee be sorry
Too see thee well curried by and by
And by Christ if any man wold it do
I my self wold help there too
For a man may see thou horesone goose
Thou would lyse thine arse if it were loose
Albeit I would never the died believe
But that the thing it self doth show and pryue
There was never Ape so like unto an Ape
As he is to me in feature, and shape
But what woll my master say trow ye
When he shall this gear here and see
Will he know me think yo^, when he shall se me
If he do not a another woll as good as he
But where is that other I? whether is he gon
To my master by cock^s precius passion
Either to put me out of my place
Or too accuse me to my master Boungrace
But I woll after as fast as I can flee
I trust to be there as soon as he
That if my master be not ready home to come
I woll be here again as fast as I can rune
I^ any wise to speak with my maysteris
Or ells I shall never escape hanging dubtles

I shall not sup this night full well I see
For as yet no body ^umithe for to fet me^
But good enough let me alone
I woll be even with them every chone
I say nothing, but I think sum what I wis
Sum there be that shall here of this
Of al unkind churlish husbands this is ye cast
To let there wives se^ at home and fast
While they be forth and make good cheer
Pastime, and sporte, as now he doth there
But if I were a wise woman, as I am a mome
I should make my self as good chere at home
But if he have thus unkindly served me
I woll not forget it this monethis three
And if I west ye fault were in him, I pray god I be ded
But he should have such a kyrie, ere he went too bed
As he never had before in all his life
Nor any man ells have had of his wy^e
I would rate him and shake him after such a sort
As should be to him a corrosive, full little to his cumforte
If I may be so bold by your ma^sterishps lyeens
As too speak and show my mind and sentence
I think of this you may the boy thank
For I know that he plays you many a like prank
And that would you say, if you knew as mu^ch as we
That his daily conversation and byhauiore s^e
For if you comm^d him to goo speak with sum one
Yt is an hour ere he wolbe gone
Then woll he rune forth, and play in the street
And cume a gain and say that he cannot with him mete

Nay, nay, it is his masters play
He seruithe me so almost every third day
But I wolbe even with him as god give me joy
And yet the fault may be^ in the boy
As ungracious a graft^ met I thrive
As any goes on gods g^d a^yue

My wit is breched in such a brake
That I cannot devise what way is best to take
I was almost as fare as my master is
But then I began to remember ^his
And to cast the worst as on in ^ere
^f he chance to see me and keep me there
Till he cum him self, speak with mi masteris
Than am I like to be in shrewd dystres
yet were I better thought I to turn hom again
And first speak with her certain
Cocks body yonder she stands at the door
Now is it wourse then it was before
Wold christ I could get again out of her sight
For I see be her look she is disposid to fight
Bi ye lord she hath there an angry shrews lo^e

Lo yender cumithe that unhappy hooke

God save you maysteris do you know me well

Cume ne'er hither unto me, and I shall thee tell
Why thou noughtie vyllan is that thy gyse
To gest with thy maisteris in such wise
take that to begyne with, and god before
when thy master cumith home thou shalt have more
For he told me when he forth went
That thou shouldest cume bake a gain inconfinente
To bring me to supper where he now is
And thou hast plaid by the way, they have don bi this
But no force I shall thou may trust me
Teach all naughty knaves to beware by thee

For sothe maisteris if you knew as much as I
ye would not be with me half so angry
For the fault is neither in mi master nor in me nor you
But in an other knave that was here even now
And his name was ienkin Careawaie

What I see my man is disposid to play
I wine he be drunken or mad I make god a vou

Nay I have bin made sobre and tame I now
I was never so handelid before in all my life
I would every man in England had so beat me his wife
I have forgotten with tousing by the here
What I devised to say a little ere

Have I lost my supper this night through thy negligece

Nay then were I a knave mysteries, saving your reverence

Why I am sure that by this time it is done

Ye that it is more then an our agone

And was not thou sent-to feache me theyth^r

Yes and had cume right quiklie hither
But that by the way I had a great fall
And my name, body shape legs and all
And meat with one, that from me did it ^elle
But be god he and I sum bloues did deal
I would he were now before your gate
For you wold poumile him ioylile about the pate

Truly this wage ^astie is either drunken or mad

Never man soffred so much wrong as I had
But maisteris I should say a thing to you
Tarry it wol cum to my remembrence even now
I must nidd^s use a substantial premeditacion
For the matter lies gretylie me a upon
I besiche your maisterishipe of pardon and forgiveness
Desyering you to impute it to my simple rude dul^nes
I have forgotten what I have thought to have said
And am thereof full ill a paid
But when I lost my self I knew very well
I lost also that I should you tell

Why thou wrechid villen doest thou me scorn and moke
To make me to these folk a laufyng stock
Ere thou go out of my hands y^ shalt have sum thing
And I woll rekine better in the morning

And if you beat me maysteris a vise you
For I am none of your servant now
That other I is now your page
And I am no long^r in your bondage

Now walk precious thife get thee out of my sight
And I charge thee cum in my presens no more this night
Get thee hens and wait on thy master at ons

Mary sir this is handeling for the noons
I wold I had bin hanged before y^ I was lost
I was never this canuased and tossed
That if my master on his part also
Handle me as my maisteris and the other I do
I shall surely be killed bitwine them three
And all the devils in hell shall not save me
But yet if the other I might have with me part
All this wold never grieve my heart

Thou say you masters I pray you tell
Have not I requited my marchent well
Have not I handelyd him after a good sort
Had it not byne pity to have lost this sporte
A none his master on his behalphe
You shall see how he woll handle the calphe
if he thoroughly angered be
He woll make him smart so mot I thee
I wold not for the price of a new pair of shone
That any part of this had bynne vndune
But now I have reu^nged my quarrel
I woll go do of this mine apparel
And now let Careawaye be Careawaye again
I have done with that name now certain
Exc^pt perauenture I shall take the self same wed
Sum other time again for a like cause and need

Why then darist thou to presume too tell me
That I know is no wise possible for to be

Now by my truth master I have told you no lie
And all these folks knowith as well as I
I had nosooner knoked at the gate
But straight ways he had me by the pate
Therefore if you bet me till I fart shit again
you shall not cause me for any payne
But I woll affirm as I said before
That when I came ne'er a another stood at ye door.

Why ye naughty villain dare yt affirm to me
that which was never scene nor hereafter shall be
That one man may have too bodies two faces
And yt one man at on time may be in too plaeis
Tell me drankest thou any where by the way

I shreue me if I drake any more the twice to day
Till I met even now with that other I
And with him I supped and drank truly
But as for you if you gave me drink and meat
As oftentimes as you do me beat
I were the best fed page in all this City
But as touching that, you have on me no pity
And not only I but all that do you sarue
For meat and dry^ke may rather starve

What you saucy malyp^rt knane
Begine you with your master to prat andraue
your tongue is liberal and all out of frame
I must niddes coung^r it and make it tame
where is ye other Careawai ^ thou said was here

Now by my chrystendome sir I wot ne'er

Why can thou find no man to moke but me

I moke you not master so mo^ I thee
Every word was true that I you told

Nay I know toys and prank of old
And now thou art not satisfied nor content
Without regard of my biddinges and commaudiment
To ha^e played by the way as a lewd know negliget
When I thee on my message home sent
But also would willingly me delude moke
And make me to all wise men a laughing stoke
showing me such things as in no wise be may
To ye intent thy leudues my turn to jest play
Therefore if you speak any such thing to me agaie
I promise it shall be unto thy payne

Loo is not he in miserable ca^e
That sarueth such a master in any place
that with force wol compel him ye thing to deny
That he knows true, and hath sine with his ye

Was it not troiest thouthine own shadoe

My shadoo could never have beten me so

Why by what reason possible may such a thing be

Nay I maruael and wonder at it more than ye
And at the first it did me curstelye mea^e
Nor I wold mine own yes in no wise belyue
Untyll that other I beat me so
That he made me beliue it whither i wold or no
And if he had your self now within his reach
He wold make you say so too or ells be shite your breach

I durst a good mede, and a wager lay
That thou laiest down and sleppest by the way
And ^remidall this that thou haste me told

Day there you lye master if I might be so bold
But we rise so erlye that if I had
I had done well and a wise lad
yet master I would you under stood
T^at I have all ways bin trusty and good
And fly as fast as a bear in a cage
When so ever you send me in your message
in faith as for this that I have told you
I saw and felt it as waking as I am now
For I had no sooner knocked at the gate
But the other I knave had me by the pate
A^d I durst to you one a book swear
That he had bin watching for me there
Lunge ere I came hyden in sum pryuye place
E^en for the nons too have me by the face

Why then thou speak not with my wife

No that I did not mai^ter by my life
Untyll that other I was gone
And then my maister^s sent me after a no^e
To weight on you home in the dyuelles name
I wene the devil never so beat his dame

And where became that other Careawaye

By mine honesty sir I cannot say
But I warrant he is now not far hens
He is here among this company for.xl. pens

Hence at tonce sike and smell him out
I shall rape thee on the lying knanes snought
I woll not be deludyd with such a glossing lye
Nor give credens till I see it with my oune iye

Truly good sir by your maistershipps favour
I cannot well find a knave by the savour
Many here smell strong but none so rank as he
A stronger scented knave then he was cannot be
But sir if he be happelye found anon
What a meds shall I have for yt you have me don

If he may befound I shall walk his cote

Ye for our lady sake sir I bisiche you spare hi not
For it is sum false knave withouten doubt
I had rath^r the.xl. pens we could find him out
For if a man may beliue a glase
Euin my very oune self it was.
And here he was but euyn right now
And steped a way sodenlie I wat not how
Of such a other thig I have nether hard no scene
By our blyssyd lady heaven q^ene

Plainelye it was thy shadow that thou did se
For in faith the other thing is not possible to be

Yes in good faith sir by your leave
I know it was I by my apples in my sleue
And speakith as like me as ever you harde
Such here, such a Cape, such Hose and cote
And in every thing as just as.iiii. pens to a grot
That if he were here you should well see
That you could not discern nor know hi fro me
For think you that I do not my self know
I am not so foolish a knave I trow
Let who woll look him by and by
And he woll depose upon a book that he is I
And I dare well say you woll say the same
For he called him self by my own name
And told me all that I have done
Since five of the cloak this after none
He could tell when you were to supper sete
you send me home my maisteris to fete
And showed me al things that I did by ye way

What was that

How I did at the Bukelers play
And when I scaterid a basket of apples fro a ^al
And gethered them into my sleue all
And how I played after that also

Thou shalt have by therefore so mote I go
Is that the guise of a trusty page
To play when he is sent on his masters message

Lay on and spare not for the love of christ
Ioll his head to a post, and favour your fist
Now for my sake sweet hart spare favour your hand
^nd lay him^ about the rybbes with this wand

Now marcy that I ask of you both twain
Save my life and let me not be slain
I have had beting enough for one day
That a mischife take the other me Careawayne
That if ever he cume to my hands again
I wis it shall be to his payne
But I maruayll greatly by our lord Ihesus
How he I escapid, I me beat me thus
And is not he I an unkind knave
That woll no more pity on my self have
Here may you see, euidentlye iwis
That in him me no drop of houestie is
Now a ^ngauce light on such a churls knave
That no more love toward my self have

I knew very well swite hart said right now
That no fault thereof should be in you

No truly good h^dfelow, I were then much unkind
if you at any time should be out of my mind

Surely I have of you a great treasure
For you do all things which may be to my pleasure

I am sorry that your chance hath now byne so ill
I would gladly byne vnsupped, so you had your fill
But goo we in pigesnie that you may sup
you bane cause now to thank this same hang up
For had not he byne you had faryd very well

I bequeth him with a hot vengeance to the devil of hell
And heartily I besiche him that hanged on the rode
That he never eat nor drink, that may do him good
And that he dye a shameful death saving my cheryte

I pray god send him such prosperity
That hath caused me to have all this business
But yet sirs you see the charitye of my maistris
She lives after a wonderful cheritable facion
For I assure you she is always in this passion
And scacelye on day throughout the hole year
She woll wish any man better chere
And sum time if she well angered be
I pray god (woll she say) y^ house may sink under me
But masters if you happen to see that other I
As that you shall it is not very likely
Nor I woll not desire you for him purposelye to look
For it is an vncomperable unhappy hooke
And if it be I, you might happin to seek
And not find me out in an hole week
For when I was wont to rune a way
I used not to cum a gain in less tha a month or tway
Houbeit for all this I think it be not I
For to show the matter in died truly
I never use to rune away in winter nor in vere
But all ways in such time and season of the year
When honey lies in the hives of Bees
And all manner fruit falls from the trees
As Apples, Nuts, Peers, and plummes also
Whereby a boy may live a brod a month or two
This cast do I use I woll not with you fain
Therefore I wonder if he be I sertaine
But and if he be, and you mete me a brod by chance
Send me home to my waister with a vengeance
And show him if he cume not ere to morrow night
I woll never receive him again if I might
And in the mean time I woll give him a groat
That woll well and thryftelye walk his cote
For a more ungracious knave is not even now
Between this place and Calycow
Nor a more frantic mad knave in bedelem
Nor a more folle hence to Iherusalem
That if to cume again, parcace he shall refuse
I woll continue as I am and let him choose
And but he cum the sooner by our lady bright
He shall lye without the doors all night
For I woll shit up the gate, and get me to bed
For I promise you I have a very gydie heed
I need no supper for this night
Nor would eat no meat though I might
And for you also master I think I best
you go to bed, and take your rest
For who of you had bin handelid as I have ben
wold not be long out of his bed I when
No more woll I but steal out of s^ght
I pray god give you all good night
And send you better hape, and fortune
The to less your self home ward as I have don

Somewhat it was says the proverb old
That the Cat winked when here iye was out
That is to say^ no tale can be told
But that sum Englyshe may be piked thereof out
if so to search the laten ground of it men will go about
As thi^ (...) enterlud yt before you hath bine rehearsed
May signify sum further meaning if it be well searched
Such is the fashion of the world now a days
That the simple innosaintes as deluded
And an hundred thousand diverse ways
By subtle and crafty means shamefullie abused.
And by strength force, and violence oft times compelled
To beliue and say the moune is made of a grene c^se
Or ells have great harm, and parcace their life less
And an old saying it is, that most times might
Force, strength, power, colorable subtlete
Do the oppre^se, dybare, ouercum and defeat right
Though yt cause stand never so greatly against equite
and ye truth thereof be know for never so y it cert^ntye
ye the pore semple innocent yt hath had wrong in^uri
Must cal ye other his good master for showing him such marcye
And as it is daily syne for fere of ferther disprofite
He must that man his best friend and master call
Of whom he never received any manner benefit
And at whose hand he never han any good at all
And must grant, affirm, or deny, what so ever he shall
He must say the Croue is whight, if he be so commanded
ye and that he him self is into a another body changed
He must say he did a miss, though he ^ d^ffee^
He must ask forgeuenes, where he did not d^part
Or ells be in troble, care and meserye with out end
And he cast in sum arrierage, without ^y gra^e
And that thing he saw done before his (...) ^ace
He must by compulsion, sufelie de^e
And for fear whether he woll or not (...) tongue ^
And in every faculte, this thing is put in (...)
And is so universal that I need no one to name
And as I fere is like evermore to endure
For it is in all faculties a coniuryie sports and game
The weker to say as yt stroger bids, or to have ^lai^
As a cunning sophist woll by argument bring to pass
That the rude shall confess, and gra^ himself an (...)
And this is ye daily exoe^e, and practise of their scoles
And not emongs them only, but also among all others
The stronger to compel and wake ^ee^e simple foals
To say as they command them in all manner matiers
I woll name none particular, but set them all togithers
with out any exception, for I pray you show me one
Among al in the world that vsethe not such fasion
He that is stronger and more of power and might
If he be disposed to revenge his cau^
woll soon pike a quarrel be it wrong b^ right
To the inferior and we (...) for a (...) of straues
And woll against him so extremely lay the laws
That he wol put him to the worse, other by false injury
Or by some craft and subtelete, or ells by plain teranie
As you saw right now, by example plain
An other fellow being a counterfeat page
Brought the gentylmans seruaunt out of his brain
And made him grant ye him self was fallen in dotag^
Bary^g him self in haud that he did rage
And when he could not bring that to pass by reason
He made him grant it, and say by compulsion
Therefore happy are they that can beware
Into whose hands they fall by any such chance
which if they do, they hardly escape care
Troble, Misery, and woeful greuaunce
And thus I make an end, committing you to his gidau
That made, redeemed us al, and to you yt be now heart
I pray god grant, and send many a good new year.
