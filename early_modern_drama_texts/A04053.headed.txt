IEsu that his arms did sprede
And on a tree was done to dead
From all perils he you defend
I desire audience till I have made an end
For am come from God above
To occupy his laws to your behove
And am named Charytye
There may no man saved be
without the help of me
For he that Charytye doth refuse
Other virtues thought he do use
^e^out charitye it will ^t ^e
For it is written in the faith
Qui mane^ in charitate in deo monet
I am the gate I tell the
Of heaven that joyful city
There may no make thither come
But of charyty he must have some
Or ye may not come iwis
Unto heaven the city of bliss
Therefore charity who will him take
A pure soul it will him make
Before the face of God
In the.A.B.C. of books the least
yt is written deus charitas est
Lo charytie is a great thing
Of all virtues it is the king
When God in earth was here living
Of charyti he found none ending
I was planted in his hart
We two might not depart
Out of his heart I did spring
Through the might of the heaven king
And all prestes that be
May singe no mass without charity
And chary to them they do not take
They may not receive him that did them make
And all this world of nought
A back fellows and give me room
Or I shall make you to avoid soon
I am goodle of person
I am pereles where ever I come
My name is youth I tell the
I florysh as the vine tree
who may belikeneth unto me
In my youth and Iolytye
My heart is royal and bushed thick
My body plyaunt as a hasel styck
Mine arms be both fair and strong
My fingers be both fair and lunge
My chest big as a tun
My legs be full light for to run
To hop and dance and make merry
By the mass I reck not a cheri
What so ever I do
I am the heir of my fathers land
And it is come into my hand
I care for nomore

Are you so disposed to do
To follow vice and set virtue go

Ye sir even so
For now a days he is not set by
Without he be vnthryftye

You had need to ask God mercy
Why do you so prase your body

Why knave what is that to the
will thou let me to praise my body
why should I not praise it it be goodli
I will not let for the

What shall it be when thou shalt flyt
For the wealth into the pyt
Therefore of it be not to boolde
Least thou forthink it when thou art old
ye may be likened to a tree
In youth floryshyng with royalte
And in age it is cut down
And to the fire is thrown
So shalt thou but thou amend
Be burned in hell without end

(...)
Be ware least thou thither go
Hence caytyfe go thy way
Or with my dagger I shall the slay
Hens knave out of this place
Or I shall lay the on the face
Say thou that I shall go to hell
For ever more there to dwell
I had leuerthou had evil fare

A yet sir do by my rede
And ask mercy for thy mysdede
And you shalt be an herytoure of bliss
Where al joy and mirth is
Where thou shall se a gloryus sight
Of augeles singing with saints bright
Before the face of God

What sirs abowe the sky
I hah need of a ladder to climb so hie
But what and the ladder slyppe
Than I am deceived yet
And if I fall I catch a quecke
I may fortune to break my neck
And that joint is ill to set
Nay nay not so

O yet remember cal to thy mind
The mercy of God passes al thing
For it is written by noble clerks
The mercy of God passes all werkes
That witnesses holy scrypture saying thus
Miseratio domini super omnia opera eius
Therefore dout not goods grace
There of is plenty in every place

what me think ye be clerkyshe
For ye speak good gibbryshe
Sir I pray you and you have any store
Soil me a questyon or ye cast out any more
Least when your conning is all done
My question have no solution
Sir and it please you this
Why do men eat mustered with salfishe
Sir I pray you soil me this question
That I have put to your discrecyon

This question is but vanity
yt longs not to me
Such questions to assoyle

Sir by god that me dere bought
I se your conning is little or nought
And I should follow your scole
Soon ye wold make a foal
Therefore crake no longer here
Least I take you on the ear
And make your head to ache

Sir it falls not for me to fight
Nether by day no be night
Therefore do my counsel I say
Than to heaven thou shalt have thy way

No sir I think ye will not fight
But to take a man purse in the night
ye will not say nay
For such holy caitifes
Were wont to be thieves
And such would be hanged as hye
As a man may se with his eye
In faith this same is true

God save every christen body
From such euell destiny
And send us of his grace
In heaven to have a place

Nay nay I warrant the
He has no place for the
We nest thou he will have such fools
To sit on his gay stools
Nay I warrant the nay

Well sir I put me in gods will
whether he will me save or spyll
And sir I pray you do so
And trust in god what so ever ye do

Sir I pray the old thy peace
And talk to me of no goodness
And soon loke thou go thy way
Lest with my dagger I the slay
In faith if thou mene my heart
Thou shalt be weary of thy part
Or thou and I have done

Think what God suffered for the
His arms to be spread upon a tree
A knight with a spear opened his side
In his heart appeared a wound wide
That bought both you and me

Gods fast what is that to me
Thou dawe will thou rede me
In my youth to lose my ioylytie
Hence knave and go thy way
Or with my dagger I shall the slay

O sir hear what I you tell,
And be ruled after my counsel
That ye might sit in heaven hye
with God and his company

A yet of God thou wilt not cease
Till I fight in good earnest
On my faith I tell the true
if I fight I tell the true
All the days of thy life

Sir I ^e wen none other wise or
I will go to my brother Humility
And take good counsel of him
Howe it is best to be do theryn

Me think it were a good sight of your back

But now among al this chere

For to beat charitye

And his brother to
Huffa, huffa who calls after me

And turn us again
For right now he was with me
And said he would go to Humility
And come to me again

Let him come if he will
He were better to bide styll
And he give the crooked langage
I will lay him on the visage
And that thou shalt se soon
How lightly it shall be done
And he will not be ruled with knocks
we shall set him in the stocks
To heal his sore shins

I shall help the if I can
To drive away that hang man
Herke Riot thou shalt understand
I am heir of my fathers land
And now they be come to my hand
Me think it were best therefore
That I had one man more
To wait me upon

To live with her all your life

For it is a careful life
Evermore to live in strife
Therefore if ye will be ruled bi mi tale

But he labours all in vain.

Sir I pray you me not spare

To hold him here still.

Iesu that was borne of Mare mild
From all evil he us shield
And send you grace to amend
Or our life be at an end

That ye live full wickedly
I pray God it amend

Lo sirs loke what I bring
Is not this a jolly ringinge
By my troth I trow it be
I will go with of charity
How say thou master charity
Doth this gear please the.

They please me well in dede
The more sorrow the more mede
For God said while he was man
Beatiqui persecutione patiutur {pro}pter iusticia
Unto his apostles he said so
To teach them howe they shulde do

we shall se how they can please
Sit down sir and take your ease
Me think these same were full meet
To go about your fair feet

By my truth I you tell
They would become him very well
Therefore hye that they were on
Unto the tavern that we were gone

That shall ye se anon
Howe soon they shall be on
And after we will not tarry lunge
But go hence with a merry songe

Let us begin all at once

Now have at it by cocks bones
And soon let us goo

Lo masters here you may see beforne
That the weed ouergroweth the corn,
Now may ye see all in this tide
How vice is taken, and virtue set aside
yonder ye may see youth is stable
But evermore changeable
And the nature of men is frail
That he wotteth not what may avail
Virtue for to make
O good Lord it is a pitiful case
Since God hath lent man wit and grace
To chose of good and evil
That man shulde voluntarylye
To such things him self apply
That his soul should spyll

Christ yt was crucified crowned with thorne

(...)
Forsake them and do after us
The better shall you do

Sire he shall do well inowe
Though he be ruled by neither of you
Therefore crake no longer here
Least you have on the ear
And that a good knock

Lightly se thou avoid the place
Or I shall give the on the face
youth I trow that he would
Make you holy or ye be old
And I swear by the rode
It is time enough to be good
When that ye be old

Sir by my truth I the say
I will make merry whiles I may
I can not tell you howe long

ye sir so mote I thryue
Thou art not certain of thy life
Therefore thou were a stark fool
To leave mirth and follow their scole

Sir I shall him exhort
Unto us to resort
And you to forsake

Ask him if he will do so
To forsake us and follow you two
Nay I warrant you nay

That shall you^ even anon
I will unto him gone
And se what he will ^aye

Hardly go on thy way
I know well he will say nay

Ye sir ^e God that me ^ere ^ght
Me think ye labour all for nought
Benest thou that I will for the
Or thy brother Charytie
Forsake this good company
Nay I warrant the

^o master I pray you of that
For any thing for sake us not
and all our counsel rule you by
ye may be Emperor or ye dye

While I have life in my body
Shall I be ruled by Riot and the

Sir than shall ye do well
For we be true as steal
Sir can teach you to play at the dice
At the quenes game and at the Iryshe
The Treygobet and the hazard also
And many other games mo
Also at the cards I can theche you to play
At the triump and one and thyrtye
Post, pinion and also aumsase
And at ad other they call dewsace
yet I can tel you more ye shyll con me thank
Pink and drink and also at the blank
And many sports mo

I thank the Riot so mote I the
For the counsel thou haste given me
I will follow thy mind in every thing
And guide me after thy learning

Youth leave that counsel for it is nought
And amend that thou hast mys wrought
That thou may save that God hath bought

What say ye master charity
whath hath God bought
By my troth I know not
(...)
He came never at the stues
Nor in no place where I do use
I wis he bought not my cap
Nor yet my ioylie hat
I wot not what he hath bought for me
And he bought any thing of mine
I will g^ue him a quart of wine
The next time I him meet

Sir this he did for the
When thou wast honde he made the free
And bought the with his blood

Sir I pray you tell me
Howe may this be
That I know I was never bond
Unto none in Englande

Sir I shall tell you
When Adam had done great trespass
And out of paradise exiled was
Then all the soles as I can you tell
were in the bondage of the devil of hell
Till the father of heaven of his great mercy
Sent the second person in Trinity
Us for to redeem
And so with his precious blood
He bought us on the rood
And our souls did save

Howe shulde I save it tell me now
and I will be ruled after you my soul to sau^

What youth will you forsake me
I will not forsake thee

I shall tell you shortly
Kneel down and ask God mercy
For that you have offended

Youth will thou do so
Follow them and let us go
Mary I trow nay

Here all sin I forsake
And to God I me betake
Good Lord I pray the have no indignation
That I a sinner shulde ask salvation

Now thou must forsake pride
And all Riot set aside

I will not him forsake
Neither early no late
I wend he would not forsake me
But if it will none otherwise be
I will go my way

Sir I pray God be your speed
and help your at your need

I am sure thou wilt not forsake me
Nor I will not forsake thee

I forsake you also
and will not have with you to do

And I forsake the utterly
Fie on the caitiff fie
Once a promise thou did me make
That thou would me never forsake
But now I se it is harde
For to trust the wretched world

Fare well masters euerycheone
For your sin look ye morn
and evil creatures loke ye turn
For your name who makes insicion
Say it is good contricion
That for sin doth morn

Here is a new array
For to walk by the way
Your prayer for to say

Here be beds for your devotion
And keep you from all temptation
Let not vice devour
When ye se mysdoing men
Good counsel give them
And teach them to amend

For my sin I will morn
All creatures I will turn
and when I see misdoinge men
Good counsel I shall give them
and exorte them to to amend

Then shall ye be an heritour of bliss
Where all joy and mirth is

To the which eternal
Go bring the persons all
Here being amen.

Thus have we brought our matter to an end
Before the persons here present
Would every man be content
Least onother day we be shente

He thank all this present
Of their meek audience

Iesu that sytteth in heaven so hye
Men and women that here be
amen amen, for charity.
