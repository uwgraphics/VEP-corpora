AS to a dying Lamp,
Gives a new Blaze, and makes it live a while;
So th'Author seeing his decaying Light,
And therefore thinking to retire from sight,
Was hindered by a Ray from th'upper Sphere,
Just at that time he thought to disappear;
He chanced to hear his Majesty once say
He liked this Plot: he staid; and writ the Play;
So should Obsequious Subjects catch the Minds
Of Princes, as your Sea-men do the Winds.
If this Attempt then shows more Zeal, than Light,
'Tmay teach you to Obey,
HA! he is there himself.
My Eyes were dazzled with Excess of Light;
Even so the Sun, who all things else displays,
Is hid from us in the Glory of his Rays;
Will You vouchsafe Your Presence? You, that were given
To be our Atlas, and support our Heaven?
Will You (Dread Sir) Your Precious Moments lose
To Grace the first Endeavours of our Muse,
This with Your Character most aptly suits
Even Heaven it self is pleased with the first Fruits.


SIgnior, Don Carlos is without.

Wait on him in.

Cozin, to me this day hath longer seemed than usual,
Since 'tis so far advanced without our seeing one another.

Me thinks so too; but you repair your Stay,
By coming hither opportunely now;
You have so often born with my Distempers,
'Tis fit that once at least you should partake
Of my Good humour.

What ere the Cause may be (I'm sure) I joy
In the Effect, and may it long continue.

I can inform you by experience now,
How great a satisfaction 'tis to find
A Heart and Head eased of a weighty care;
For a Gentleman of my warm temper,
Jealous of the Honour of his Family,
(Yet never blemished) to be fairly freed
From the Tuition of an Orphan Sister,
Rich, Beautiful, and Young.

You know, Don Henrique, that for divers years,
Your Friend has been with the like Province charged,
A tender Sister, by our Parents will,
(When they were called from all their Cares below)
To mine committed; and though more exposed
Still to the world than yours; and (Sir) unless
Nearness of blood deceive me, short of few
In the advantages that draw Pretenders;
Yet thanks to my Temper, Cozin, as well
As to her Virtue, I have seen her grow
Up from her Childhood, to her Dangerous Age,
Without the least Disturbance to my rest:
And when with equal Justice I reflect
On the great Modesty and Circumspection
Of lovely Porcia, I conclude, that you
Might well have slept as Undisturbed as I.

Sir, I complain not of my Sisters conduct;
But you know well, young Maids are so exposed
To the Invasion of audacious men,
And to the Malice of their envious Sex,
You must confess the Confines of their Fame
Are never safe till guarded by a Husband;
The wisdom of Relations ought to use
Preventions of all sorts; but dear Carlos,
The Blemish once received, no Wash is good
For stains of Honour, but th'Offenders blood.

Y' are too severe a Judge of point of Honour.

And therefore having not long since received
The news, that Don Antonio Pimentel,
Is likely to be here this night from Flanders;
To whom my Sister by Velladas means,
(Our common Friend and Patron) is contracted;
I will not close these eyes till I have seen
Her, and my Cares, safe lodged within his arms.

I find you travels, Cozin, have not cured you
Of that innate Severity to Women,
Which grows to be a National reproach
Unto us all abroad; the world laments
That miserable Sex amongst us here,
Born only to be honourable Prisoners;
The more of Quality, the Closer kept;
Which Cruelty is revenged upon our selves,
Whilst by Immuring those whom most we Love,
We sing and sigh only to Iron Grates.
As cruel is that over-cautious use,
By Proxy to contract Parties Unknown
To one another; this is only fit
For Sovereign Princes, whose high qualities
Will not allow of previous interviews;
They sacrifice* their Love to Public good,
Consulting only Interest and Blood.
A custom, which as yet I never know
Used between persons of a Lower rank,
Without a sequel of sad Consequence:
Sir, understand me right; I speak not this
By way of Prophecy; I am no stranger
To Don Antonios great reputation,
Which I believe so just, I no way doubt
Your Sisters being happy in him.

Don Carlos, let us quit this Argument;
I now am going to our noble friend
And kinsman the Corigidor, to see
If he will honour with his Company
My Sisters Wedding; will you come along?

Most willingly; as soon as I have brought
My Sister hither, and left her with yours.

I have some business, Cozin, by the way,
I'll go before, Piazza.
Your Servant, Cozin.
This Kinsman is my bosom friend, and yet
Of all men living, I must hide from him
My deep resentments of his Sisters scorn;
That cruel Maid, to wound me to the Heart,
Then close her Ears against my just complaints;
But though as yet I cannot heal my wound,
I may, by my Revenge upon my Rival
Divert the Pain; and I will drive it home;
There's in Revenged a Balm, which will appease
The present grief, and Time cure the disease.

My heart is so oppressed, with fear and grief,
That it must break, unless it find relief;
The Man I love is forced to fly my sight,
And like a Parthian, kills me in his flight:
One whom I never saw, I must embrace,
Or else destroy the honour of my race.
A Brothers Care, more cruel than his Hate;
O how perplexed is my unhappy fate!

Cozin, I thought my Sisters company
Would not displease you, whilst I wait upon
Your Brother in visit.

Sir, you oblige me with a welcome favour;
I rather should have styled it Charity,
To bring a friend to her, whose cruel fate
Has robbed her of her self.

Me thinks, 'tis pity that a wall should make
The houses two, of friends so entirely one,
As you, and I, and our two Brothers are.

If it be true, that Lovers live much more,
There where they Love, than where they Breath, I'm sure
No walls can sever us, w' are still together.

Were I not much engaged, I would not quit
So sweet a Conversation; but, Sister,
At my return, I'll wait upon you home.

For this night, Cozin, pray let her be mine,
I beg it of you both.

You may command, we are both yours.

My dear Camilla,
Where freely breathing out my Grief, I might
Some mitigation from thy Pity find;
But since there's no true Pity without Pain;
Why should I Ease, by thy Affliction gain?

Ah Porcia! if Compassion Suffering be,
And to Condole be Pain; my Destiny
Will full revenge in the same kind afford;
Should I, but my unequalled griefs relate,
And you, but equally participate.

If yours, as mine, from Love-disasters rise,
Our Fates are more alli'd than Families.

What, to our Sex, and blooming age can prove
An anguish worthy of our Sighs, but Love?

'Tis true, Camilla, were your fate like mine,
Hopeless to hold, unable to resign.

Let's tell our Stories, then we soon shall see,
Which of us two excells in Misery.

Cozin, agreed.

Do you begin then.

You know, Camilla, best, how generously,
How long, and how discreetly, my Octavio
Hath served me; and what trials of his faith
And fervour I did make, ere I allow'd
The least hope to sustain his noble Love.
Cozin, all this you know; 'twas in your House
We had our interviews; where you were pleased
To suffer feigned addresses to your Self,
To cover from my watchful Brother's eyes,
The real passion which he had for me.

My memory in this needs no refreshing.

And how one Evening (O that fatal hour)
My Brother passing by Don Carlos house,
With his great Friend and Confident Don Pedro,
Did chance to see the unfortunate Octavio,
At your Balcony, entertaining me,
Whom not believing there, he took for you;
Where mad with Jealousy, his cruel nature
(To which all Moderation is unknown)
Resolves to stamp all your Neglects of him,
In's supposed Rival poor Octavio's heart;
He, and his Friend both draw, Octavio
Retires, they assault him, who in's own defence
Does kill Don Pedro, and is forced to fly.
My Brother cruelly pursues him still,
With such insatiate thirst after revenge,
That nothing but Octavio's blood can quench;
Yet covering still his Rage and Jealousy,
With the resentment of Don Pedro's death.

Is this the sum of your sad story, Porcia? Is this all?

No, no, Camilla, 'tis the Prologue only,
The Tragedy does follow; this Tyrant,
This cruel Brother, to th'Impetuous Laws
Of whose Tuition, our deceased Parents
My Person and my Fortune have condemned,
In his unjust Suspicion restless grown,
(Which he to palliate Vice with Virtues name,
Does Sense of Honour call) takes an Alarm,
And starts at every shadow; as if reproach
Attended all the actions of a Sister,
Though ne'er so Circumspect; and uses me,
As if the Honour of our Family
Were over-thrown for ever* should my Eyes,
Or Judgment, be but the least part allow'd
In making choice of him should be my Husband.
Therefore to frustrate all my hopes at once,
He has already marri'd me by Proxy,
To one in Flanders, whom I never saw,
Who is this very night expected here.

Is such a rigour possible, dear Porcia?

Was ever Misery like mine, Camilla?
Heightened to such extremes, past all relief?
If I acquaint my Brother with my Love
To Octavio, the man he most does Hate,
I must expect the worst effects of fury;
If I endeavour to Forget Octavio,
Even that attempt renews his memory,
And fresh Disquiet gives; If I refuse
To marry, I am lost; If I obey,
I cast Octavio and my self away.
Two such Extremes of ill, no Choice admit,
Each seems the Worst; on which Rock shall I split?
Since if I marry, I cannot survive;
And not to marry; were to die alive.

Your Story (I confess) is strangely moving;
Yet if you could my Fortune weigh with yours,
In Scales of equal Sensibility,
You would not change your Sufferings, for mine.

What can there be in Nature more afflicting,
Than a Divorce from th'Object of our Love,
For ever, to embrace the thing we Hate?

Have you not known that Object of your Love?
And entertained the Person you esteem?
Have you not heard, and answered to his Sighs?
Has he not born his Part in all your Cares?
Do not you live, and reign within his heart?

I doubt no more his Faith, that my hard Fate.

But tell me, dearest Porcia, if I love
One, I ne'er shall see, and suffer as much
Without the Means of ever expressing it,
As what I suffer is above expression;
If all my Sighs wander in fleeting Air,
And ne'er can reach his ears for whom they're formed;
If all my Passion, all my killing Cares,
Must be for ever* to their Cause unknown;
If that their weight must sink me to my Grave,
Without one Groan that he can ever hear,
Or the least hope, that I should ever obtain
By Pity Ease, or Cure by his Disdain:
If this the state of my Misfortune be,
Say, dearest Porcia, do you envy me?

What over-cruel Laws of Decency
Have struck you dumb? have you misplaced your Love,
On such a Subject, as you dare not own?

No, the Cause is worthy of the Effect;
And though I had no Passion for his Person,
I were Ungrateful if I should not give
The first place in my Heart to such high Merit.

If he has been so Generous, to deserve
Your Love, why are not you so Just, to let
Him know it?

'Tis impossible; Ah! that dismal word
Does full state the Difference of our Fortunes:
You, in your first Adventure have been crossed,
But I, before I can set out am lost.

Pray make me comprehend this Mystery.

'Tis to open my wounds afresh, dear Porcia,
But You must be obeyed --
The Conde de Onniate being sent
Ambassador unto the Emperor;
We having the honour to be near allied
To him, by his Lady, (who likewise went
That Journey with her Husband) my Brother
Was desired by her to make that Voyage;
Whose tenderness for me, nor suffering him
To let me stay behind, I was engaged;
And treated by the Ambassadress, my Cozin,
With more respect than I could ever merit.

She's a Lady, famed for great Civility.

We had not passed much time in the, Emp'ror'S Corut,
When my dear Brother unexpectedly,
By urgent business, was called back to Sevil;
And in our return (too near a Garrison
Of th'Enemies) our Convoy was surprised,
And routed by a Party of their Horse.

Camilla, you begin to raise my fears.

We Prisoners made, were hurried straight away
To their Quarters, where my malicious Fate
Made me appear too pleasing to the Eyes
Of their Commander; who at first approach
Pretends to Parley in a Lovers style,
Protesting that my Face had changed our Fortunes,
And him my Captive made: But finding soon
How little he advanced in his Design
By Flattery, and his feigned Submission;
He shifts his Person, calls me his Prisoner,
And swears my Virgin-Treasure was his Prize;
And yet protests he had much rather owe it
To my Indulgence, than his own Good Fortune;
And so through Storms and Calms, the Villain still
Pursues his Course to his accursed End;
But finding me inflexible to Threats
As well as Fawnings, he resolves to use
The last, and uncontrolled Argument
Of Impious Men in Power, Force.

Ah poor Camilla! tell me, where was then
Your Brother, at a time of such distress?

My Brother? he, alas, was long before
Born away from me, in the first Encounter;
Where having certainly behaved himself
As did become his Nation and his Name,
Remained sore wounded in another House.

Prithee make haste to free me from this fright.

The Brute approaches; and by Violence
Endeavours to accomplish his intent;
I Heaven invoke, and strong Resistance make,
But with Unequal force, though Rage supplied
Those Spirits, which my Fear had put to flight;
Breathless at length with crying out, and striving,
I spied a Dagger by the Villain's side,
Which snatching boldly out, as my last refuge,
With his own Arms I wound the Savage Beast;
He, at the stroke, unseas'd me, and gave back;
( So Guilt produces Cowardice) then I
The Dagger pointing to my breast, cried out,
Villain, keep off, for if thou dost persist,
I'll be my self both Sacrifice and Priest;
I boldly now defy thy Lust, and Hate;
She that dares Choose to die, may Brave her Fate.
Immediately the Drums and Trumpets sound,
Pistols go off, and a great cry, To Arms,
To Arms: The Lustful Satyr flies; I stand
Fixed with amazement to the Marble floor,
Holding my Guardian Dagger up aloft,
As if the Ravisher had threatened still.

I fancy thee, Camilla, in that brave posture,
Like a noble Statue, which I remember
To have seen, of the enraged Juno,
When she had robbed Jove of his Thunderbolt.

Freed from this Fright, my Spirits flow so fast
To the forsaken Channels of my Heart,
That those who by their orderly access
Would have Supported life, by Throngs oppress.
O're-charg'd with Joy, I fell into a Swoon;
And what was done in this Parenihesis
Is not within the Circle of my Knowledge.

Y' have raised me to a mighty Expectation;
Will the Adventure answer it, Camilla?

At my return to life, opening my eyes,
Think, dearest Porcia, how I was astonished,
To find there kneeling by my side, a Man,
Of a most noble Form, who bowing to me,
Madam, (says he) you're welcome to the world;
Pardon, I pray, the Boldness of a Stranger,
That humbly sues t'you to Continue in it;
Or if You needs will Leave us, stay at least
Till I shall have Revenged your wrongs, and then
I'll wait upon you to the other world,
For You with-drawn, this will a Desert seem,
And Life a Torment.

High gallantry, Cozin, for a first Address.

'Twas so Surprising, that my Confusion
Checked my Reply: but I suppose my Looks
Did speak the grateful Language of my Heart;
For I perceived an Air of Joy enlighten
His manly Face; out, O! it soon was clouded,
By fresh Alarms; We heard the Soldiers cry,
Where's Antonio, th'Enemy is rallied,
And coming on to give Second Charge;
He started up, and with a Men, that marked
The Conflict 'twixt his Honour and his Love;
Madam, (says he) the Soul was never yet
With such Convulsion from the Body torn,
As I from you; but it must ne'er be said,
That Don Antonio Pimentel was seen
To Follow in Dangers those he ought to Lead;
And thus the Vanquished Conqueror Disappeared,
Leaving that Image stamped upon my Heart,
To which I all the Joys must Sacrifice
Of the poor remnant of my wretched Life;
If properly to live I may be said,
When all my hopes of Seeing him are dead.

What said you was his name, Camilla?

Don Antonio Pimentel, I told you.

O Heavens! Antonio Pimentel?

I'm pleased to find you Speaking of your Husband.

What's that I hear?

Have you the Letter ready, I desired you
To write to him? I'll send a Servant with it,
To meet him on the way, 'twill show Respect.

You know my Obedience, Brother.

'Tis well, Sister.

Sir, here's a Servant of Don Antonio,
Newly alighted at the Gate; he's come
Post from his Master, charged with Letters for You.

You ne'er could bRing me a more welcome News;
Call him in, Sylvio: Sister, you may
With-draw, and take this time to ask your Cozin,
How she likes my Choice of your Wedding-Cloathes.

My Wedding-Cloathes? Ah! miserable Maid!
The Heathen so to their Feigned Deities
adorned the Victims they did Sacrifice.

Signior, Don Antonio kisses your hands,
And sends me to present this Letter to you.

I'm glad you left him well; but yet me thinks,
He writes doubtfully of his being here
This night, as I expected.

His Letter, I suppose, declares his purpose.

I'll answer't, and dispatch you presently.
In the mean while go make him welcome, Sylvio.

Meethinks, Camerade, a soup of Chocolate
Is not amiss after a tedious Journey;
Your Master's Health,

I'll do you reason, Sir.

Pray how long is't, Brother, since you left Spain?

'Tis now five years, and upward, since I went
From Sevil, with my Master, into Flanders,
The King's Fencing-School; where all his Subjects,
Given to Fighting, are taught the Use of Arms,
And notably kept in breath.

Your Master, I am sure, has got the Fame
To be a Per'lous man in that rough Trade.

He's a brave Soldier, Envy must confess it.

If seems so i'faith, since merely by the force
Of his great Reputation, he can take our Bright
Young Mistress so, without a Siege.

I hope she'll be Revenged on him ere long,
And take him too, by the force of her Wit,
And Beauty.

S'has more than a Child's Portion, Sir, of both,
I dare assure you.

But, prithee, Brother, instruct me a little,
Tell me, what kind of Country is this Holland,
That's so much talked of, and so much fought for.

Why, Friend, 'tis a huge Ship at Anchor, fraught
With a sort of Creatures, made up of Turf,
And Butter.

I pray, Sir, what do they drink in that Country?
'Tis said, there's neither Fountains there,
Nor Vines.

This is the B^tler sure by his apt question.
Friend, they drink there a certain muddy Liquor,
Made of that Grain with which you feed your Mules.

What? Barley? can that Liquor quench their thirst?

You'd scarce believe it did, had you but seen
How oft they drink.

But, me-thinks, that should make them drunk, Camera^

Indeed most Strangers do think so, but they
Themselves believe it not, because they're so,
So often.

A Nation sure of Walking Tuns; the World
Has not the like.

Pardon me, Friend, there is but a great Ditch
Butwixt them and such another Nation;
If these Good-fellows would but Join, and drink
That dry, i'faith they might shake hands.

Prithee, Friend, can these Dutch Borraccios Fight?

They can do even as well, for they can Pay
Those that can fight.

But where, I prithee, do they get their Money?

Oh, Friend, they have a Thriving Mystery;
They Cheat their Neighbouring Princes of their Trade,
And then they Buy their Subjects for their Soldiers.

Me-thinks our Armies should beat these Dull Fellows
Out of the World.

These Dull Fellows will sooner beat our Armies
Out of their Country; Why, Friend, ready Money
Will do much more, in Camps, as well as Courts,
Than a Ready Wit, I dare assure you.

What a Gods name could come into the Heads
Of this People, to make them Rebel?

Why Religion, that came into their Heads
A Gods name.

But what a Devil made the Noble-men Rebel?

Why that which made the Devil himself Rebel, Ambition.

This is a pleasant Fellow;
I find that you Soldiers do not want Wit.

But I find he wants Wit that is a Soldier.
Gentlemen, your Company's very good,
But I have business that requires Dispatch.

Will you not mend your Draught before you go?

I thank you, Sir, I have done very well.

Was ever Misfortune like to mine, Camilla?

Was ever Disaster, P^rcia, like to mine?

That I must never see Octavio more.

That I again must Don Antonio see,
Never to see him Mine.

I, to be marri'd to the Man I HaTe.

And I, to have the Man I Love, torn from me.

I am, by Robbing of my Friend, undone.

And I (alas) by Yielding, ruin both.

Ye Powers, who these entangled fortunes give,
Instruct us how to Die,

Cozin, when we should Act, then to Complain,
Is Childishly to beat the Air in vain.
The sedescants on our Griefs do but Perplex,
Let's seek the Remedy; You know, our Sex
This Honour beats from Men, in Exigents
Of Love, never to want Expedients.

You have awakened me, give me your Veil,
Quickly, my Dearest, quickly; and You, Flora,
Run and see if my Brother be settled
To the Dispatching of Antonio's Man.

What mean you, Porcia?

If once my Brother be set down to write,
I may securely reckon one hour mine;
His Wits are only in his Choler quick
And his Hand ready in Revenge; he's so
Extravagantly Jealous, he distrusts
The Meaning of his own ill-chosen Words,
And so at length can hardly fix on any.
This Time I will make use of to go see
Octavio, and let him know that the last Term
Of all our Hopes is ready to Expire,
Unless his Wit, his Courage, and his Love,
Some quick Expedient find for our Relief.

Why, How, and Where do you hope to speak with him?

In his own House, where he does lie concealed,
'Tis not far off, and I will venture thither.

Know you the way?

Not very well, but Flora's a good Guide.

O Madam! he's coming already.

Ah spiteful Destiny! let us retire,
Corin, into my Chamber.

If you desire to speak with her, you may.

I should be very glad to tell my Master
That I have had the Honour to see his Bride.

Where'oyour Lady, Flora?

She's in her Chamber, Signior.

Tell her, ^ does desire
To do his Duty to her, ere he goes.
Friend, you will find her there, without a Veil,
In her Home Dress, but you are privileged
For this free Access, by your Relation.
Whilst you wait on her, I'll go end my Letter.

If thou love me, get him quickly away,
Before my Brother come,

Madam, I have been bold to beg the Honour
Of Seeing you, to make my self more welcome
To my Lord, at my return.

A rare Mistake, Camilla.
Who knows what Good this Error may produce?

Friend, in what state left you your Lord and mine?

As happy as the Hopes of being Yours
Ought certainly to make him, Madam.

I would the Master were as easily deceived.
I pray present my Humble Service to him:
Flora, give him the Letter; Farewell.

Now by my Life, she is a lovely Lady;
My Master will be ravished with her Form;
I hope the Bargain, which her Brother made,
By the interposal of Vellada's Power,
(Though founded only in Interest) may prove
As happy a Marriage, as any other
Made after th'old fashion, chiefly for Love;
And that so rare a Beauty may have power
To bring him back to his right Wits again
From his wild Ravings on an unknown Dame,
Whom as he fancies (once upon a time)
He recovered from a Trance, that is,
From a sound Sleep, to make him Dreame'r since.
I'll hasten to him with this pleasing news.

My Melancholy could hardly hinder me
From laughing at the Formal Fools mistake;
But tell me, did not I present your Per^age
With assurance? the way for both to thrive,
Is to make me your Representative,

Most willingly, and I am confident,
When you, your Charms shall to his heart apply,
You all your Rivals safely may defy.

I wish I could be vain enough to hope it.
But, Cozin, my Despairs are so Extreme,

I can't be flattered, though but in a Dream.

Madam, do we go, or what d' you resolve on?

I must resolve, I see, yet know not what.

Cozin, take heed, I am afraid you venture
Too much, your Brother cannot tarry long;
And, if returning, he should find you missing --

Y'have reason, the opportunity is lost,
What is't a Clock, Flora?

I think near Eight, for the Clock struck seven,
Just as Camilla entered the Chamber.

Quick then, Flora, fetch your Veil, you shall carry
My Tablets to Octavio, there he'll find
The Hour and Place where I would have him meet.

'Tis well resolved; but where do you design Your Meeting?

In the Remotest part of all the Garden,
Which answers (as you know) to my apartment;
And Flora has the Key of the Back-door.

As the Case stands, you choose the fittest place.

Cozin, I beg your patience whilst I write.

You, Flora, by this Accident may chance
To see your faithful Lover Diego.

He is a faithful Lover of himself,
Without a Rival, Madam.

Damsel, your Words and Thoughts do not agree;
For could we see his Image in your Heart,
'Twould be a fairer far, than ere his Glass Reflected.

Madam, I am not yet so very Old,
That I should Dote.

Nor yet so very Young, but you may Love.
Dotage and Love are Cozin-germans, Flora.

Yes,
For else, I think, they're not so near a kin.

I've tou^h'd a Nettle,

Make haste, Flora

Madam, I'll (...).
Should I not play my part, I were to blame,
Since all my Fortune's betted on her game.
Madam, has Octavio the other Key
Belonging to the Tablets.

Yes, yes, I pray make haste.
Let us retire, Camilla a little Rest,
And Meditation, may new aids suggest.

SIr, we are arrived in very good time.

I did not think it would have been so soon,
By an hour at least, but Lovers ride apace.
Why smile you, Sancho?

Faith at the Novelty of your Amours,
To fall in Love with one, you Scarcely saw,
And marry one, you Never saw; 'tis pretty;
But we poor Mortals have another Method.

You're very pleasant; this, Sancho, is the place,
Where I charged Ernesto to expect me,
Whom I sent before to my Brother-in-Law;
But with this Order, not to let him know,
That I intended to arrive this Evening:
Surprises in Love-meetings render Men
More welcome, and have more of Gallantry.

Since you are here, Sir, earlier than you thought;
Why might you not go shift you at the Post-house?
And be back here, before Ernesto come,
However, 'tis better, that he wait for you,
Than you for him in the open Street.

'Tis well thought on; come, let's to the Post-house.

Come, Diego, tis time to quit our Lurking-holes,
And to begin our Chase:

Of what, Sir? Bats, or Owls, now the Sun's set?
Call you this making of Love? me-thinks, 'tis
More like making of War; marching all night
In Arms, as if we designed to Beat up
The Enemies Quarters.

Why would not thou venture as much for Flora?

No in good faith; shall venture enough
If ever I Marry her; I'll run no hazard,
(By my good-will) before hand.

That's from your Fear, not Prudence, Diego.

Sir, you may call it what you please, but I
Dare boldly say, there lives not in the world
A more Valiant Man, than I, whilst Danger
Does keep its Distance; but when saucily
It presses on, then (I confess) 'tis true,
I have a certain Tenderness for Life,
That checks my Ardor, and enclines my Prudence
Timely to withdraw.

Your Style is wondrous civil to your self;
How you Soften that harsh word, called Cowardice;
But the Danger is not always evident,
When you are pleased, my Friend, to Run away.

It may be so, Sir, not to Vulgar eyes;
But I have such a piercing sight, that can
Discover Perils out of others Ken;
Which, they not seeing soon enough to Shun,
Are forced t'Encounter; and then their struggling
Is, by th'unwarie world, taken for Courage.

You have more Light, Diego, I see, than Heat;
But I'll allow your Wit and Honesty
To come to Composition for your want
Of Courage; though it be a Quality
I may have use of; but we lose our time.
Was ever Lover's Fare so rude as mine?
Condemned to Darkness, forced to hide my Head,
As well as Love? and to do me a Spite,
Fortune has Contradictions reconciled,
I am at once a Prisoner, and Exiled.

Me-thinks, Ernesto should not tarry long,
If not already come; Sancho, how call you
The (...) there just before us? where you see
You Gentleman with his Cloak over his face;
I have quite lost the memory of this place.

I am as much to seek, as you, Sir.

Let us golto him, Sancho, and enquire*
He has a notable good Men; me-thinks,
I ne'er saw an Air more like Octavio's

Unless my eyes do very much deceive me,
'Tis Don Antonio; if it be he, Diego,
There is no danger in his knowing us;
He ever was my faithful friend; 'Tis he.

You injure me, Octavio, no be so long
A knowing one, who is so entirely yours.

Your presence, here, noble Antonio, was So unexpected,
Believe my eyes, When came you to this Town?

I am just (...) arrived

I joy to see you here, but should have thought
It likelier to have heard of you at Court,
Pursuing there the Recompenses due
To your transcendent Merit.

That is no place for men of my Morality.
I have been taught, Octavio, to Deserve,
But not to Seek Reward; that does profane
The Dignity of Virtue; if Princes
For their own Interests will not advance
Deserving Subjects, they must raise Themselves
By a brave Contempt of Fortune.

I'm glad to find in you some Seeds yet left
Of the Ancient Virtue; may they Fruit produce
Fit to Illu rate, and Instruct the Age.
Let me once more embrace you, Sir, Welcome,
Brave Leader.

Oh, you must spare your Servants, Sir.

He has not lived in the reach of public Fame,
Who has not heard your noble Character;
This is my house, be pleased, Sir, to go in,
And make it yours; though truly at the present
I am in a very ill condition
To receive the Honour of such a Guest;
Having by an unlucky accident,
Been forced of late to keep my self concealed.

I humbly thank you, Sir, but cannot yet
Receive that favour, for I here must stay
Expecting the Return of one, I sent
Before to town to my Brother-in-Law.

Have you a Brother-in-law in Sevil?
You surprise me much.

It is most true, Octavio, I come hither
A Marri'd man, as far as friends can make me.

Since it imports you not to miss your Servant,
Let us stay here without, until he come;
And then go in, and rest your self a while.
But how go our public Affairs in Flanders?

I left our Armies in a better state,
Than formerly.

And our brave Vellada (I suppose) in great Reputation.

The Honour of our Country, and the Terror
Of others; Fortune consulted Reason,
When she bestowed such Favours upon him.

They say he did VVonders at the Relief of Juliers.

It was indeed a famous Action.

You'll much oblige me, if whilst you expect
Your Servant here, I might learn from your self
Some few particulars of your own Actions;
Fame speaks Loudly of them, but not Distinctly.

Fame, like Water, bears up the Lighter things, And lets the Weighty sink; I am
not used
To speak in the First person; but if needs
You'll have a story to fill up the time,
I'll tell you an Adventure of mine own,
Where you'll find Love so intermixed with Arms,
That (I am confident) 'twill raise your wonder,
How being prepossessed with such a Passion,
I should (upon Prudential motives only)
Be engaged (as now you find me) to Merry
A Lady whom I never saw.

The Person, and the Subject, Sir, do challenge My best attention.

The following Evening to that glorious Day,
Wherein our great Vellada gained such Fame,
Against the cautelous Nassaw* some Horse
Were sent from th'Armie, under my command
To cover the Limbourg Frontiers, exposed
To th'Enemies Inroads; scarce settled there,
I received intelligence, that a Party
Of theirs (about two hundred Horse) were come
That very Evening to a neighbouring Village,
Intending there to lodge; I instantly
Cause Sound to Horse, and march to their Surprise
So luckily, that by the break of day
Their Quarters were on fire.

You had been taught, Sir, by our wise General,
That Diligence in Execution is
Even above Fortune, Mistress of Success.

They made but faint resistance; some were slain,
Some perished in the flames, other escaped,
Giving th'Alarm in Quarters more remote
To their Companions drowned in Sleep and Wine;
Who, at the Out-cry, and the Trumpets sound,
Me-thinks I fancy starting from their Beds,
As pale and wan, as from their Dormitories
Those the last Trump shall rouse; differing in this,
That they awake to Live, but these to Die.

How Unsafe it is to be Secure!

Finding no more resistance, I made haste
To a lofty Structure, which I conceived
To be the likeliest Quarter for their Chief;
Led thither by desire to rescue both;
Him, from the Soldier's rage; That, from the Fire.

A care most worthy of a gallant Leader.

But think, Octavio, how I was surprised,
When, on the floor of a Pavillion,
Belonging to the Garden of that House,
I found a Woman of a Matchless Form,
Extended all along.

I easily can divine how such a Heart,
As harbours in the brave Antonio's breast,
May suffer at so Sad a Spectacle.

At the first sight I did believe her Dead;
Yet, in that state so Awful she appeared,
That I approached her with as much Respect,
As if the Soul had animated still
That Body, which, though Dead, scarce Mortal seemed.
But as the Sun from our Horizon gone,
His Beams do leave a Tincture on the Skies,
Which shows it was not long since he withdrew;
So in her lovely face there still appeared
Some scattered streaks of those Vermillion Beams,
Which used t'irradiate that bright Firmament.
Thus did I find that distressed Miracle,
Able to Wound a Heart, as if alive,
Incapable to Cure it, as if dead.

I no more doubt your Pity, than your Wonder.

My Admiration did suspend my Aid,
Till Passion joined to Pity, made me bold;
I kneeled, and took her in my arms, then bowed
Her body gently forward; with which motion,
A Sigh stole from her; O th'ravishing sound!
Which being a Symptom of remaining life,
Made me forget it was a sign of Grief.
At length she faintly opens her bright eyes;
So breaks the Day; and so do all the Creatures,
Rejoice, as I did, at the new born Light:
But as the Indians, who adore the Sun,
Are scorched by's Beams, ere Half his Race be Run;
So I, who did adore her Rising Eyes,
Found my self Wounded by those Deities.

How you have raised my Expectation!
Pray release me quickly.

From her fair hand a bloody Poniard fell,
Which she held fast during her Trance, as if
Sh'ad only needed Arms whilst she did Sleep,
And trusted to her Eyes whilst she did Wake.
What I said to her, being a production
Of mere Ecstasy, I remember not;
She made me no Reply, yet I discerned
In a Serener Air of her pale face,
Some Lines of Satisfaction mixed with Fear.

Such looks in Silence have an Eloquence.
But pray go on.

Raised from the ground, and to her self returned,
I stepped a fitting distance back; as well
To gaze upon that lovely Apparition,
As to express Respect; when at that instant
The Trumpets sound a Charge; my Soldiers cry,
Where is our Leader? where's Antonio?
My Love a while disputed with my Honour,
But that the longer settled Power o'r-came,
And fear of Future danger to her Person
Made me then seek the Present for my self;
I came up to my Troops, left in Reserve,
As they were ready to receive a Charge
From divers Squadrons of fresh Horse, who being
Quartered in Neighbouring Villages, had taken
Hotly th'Alarm, and came (though then too late)
In succour of their friends; Honour and Love
Had so inflamed my heart, that I advanced
Beyond the Rules of Conduct, and received
So many wounds, that I with faintness fell.

How can this Story end!

My Soldiers beat the Enemy, and brought me off,
Where Surgeons quickly cured my Outward Wounds,
But the remembrance of that Heroine,
My Inward Hurts kept bleeding still afresh;
Till by the business of the War constrained
To attend my Charge i'th'Army, my despair
Of ever finding her, concurring with
The powerful persuasions of Vellada,
I was at length even forced to an Engagement
Of Marriage with a Lady of this City,
Rich, Noble, and, as they say, Beautiful.
And so you have me here, come to Consummate
Those Nuptial Rites, to which my Interest,
And th'Importunity of Friends advice,
O're-rule my judgment, though against my heart.

A wonderful Adventure! but pray, Sir,
May I not take the liberty to ask you,
Who may this noble Lady be, to whom
The Fates have destined so much Happiness?

I have no Reserves for you, 'tis the Sister Of --
It is my Servant, Sir.


Step to Antonio, Diego, and desire him To send him off.

I will immediately; Ernesto,
What good news? speak freely.

Sir, as you charged me, I told your Brother-in-Law,
I thought you hardly could be there this night;
He kisses your hands, and bad me tell you,
That he expects your coming with impatience;
He charged me to present you with this Letter;
The other is from your beauteous Bride, a person
The most accomplished that I ever saw.
My being yours gave me the privilege
Of a Domestic, in the free admission
To see her in her Chamber-dress, without
A Veil, either to cover Faults, or hide Perfections.

Tell me truly, is she so very handsome?

Handsomer far in my opinion, Sir,
Than all the Bruxels Beauties, which you call
The Finished Pieces; but I'll say no more;
Let your own Eyes inform you; here's a Key
Of the Apartment, that's made ready for you;
A Lower Quarter, very nobly furnished,
That opens on St. Vincent's Street.

Give it me; and go you to the Post-house,
And take care that my things be brought from thence.
Octavio, will you go along with me,
And be a Witness of my first Address?

Sir, you choose in me an ill Companion
For Nuptial Joys, or any Happiness;
One, whose Misfortunes to such sad Extremes
Are heightened, that the very Mentioning
Of Happy hours serves only to Embitter
The memory of my Lost Joys.

So deep a sense of your Misfortunes, Sir,
Is prejudicial to your Self and Friends.

Where's your Master, Diego?

There's some Ill towards,
Do you not see him? I have lived too long a Maid.

I have something to say to you in private,
That requires haste.

What new Accident brings you hither, Flora?

These Tablets will inform you,

Will you not stay for an Answer Damsel?

'Tis a Command, not a Question Diego.

Short, and Sweet, Flora.

Good Flora stay a Minute; I much fear It is some new Misfortune.

Nay, Sir, you may be sure 'tis some Disaster,
Else it would ne'er have come so Easily,
And so Unsought for.

Will you allow me for a Moment,
To step into my House, and read a Letter.

I'll attend you in, and wait your leisure.

These little black Books do more Devils raise,
Than all the Figures of the Conjurers.
What can this be? I have not seen this Damsel
With so busy a face; but here she comes
Already, 'twas a quick dispatch.

A Word, Flora, or a kind Glance at least,
What? grown cruel? Diego no body w'you?

This is no time for fooling.

Nay, if you be so serious, fare you well;
Yet I'll perform the Honour of our Street,
And bring you to the end on it.

I shall be well help up with such a Squire;
If now some wandering Knight should chance t'assault you,
To bear away your Damsel, what would you do?

I'd use no other Weapon but a Torch;
I'd put aside your Veil, show him your face,
That, I suppose, would guard us both.

Why, do you think it would fright him, Diego?

Oh no, 'twould charm him, Flora.

Well, such as 'tis, I'll venture it without Engaging your known Valour.

Faith you may so;
The face, dear Flora, defends all below.

Away, you Fool; Good-night to you.

What may this be? O my Malignant Fate!
The Warning's short, yet she must be Obeyed;
The hour draws near;
Her words seem to imply need of a Second;
'Twere barbarous to engage Antonio
Newly arrived, and come on such an Errand.
Noble Antonio, my confusion's great
To tell you thus abruptly, I must leave you;
The occasion's indispensable.

I must not quit you, Sir, I know too well
The Laws of Honour, to desert you now:
When I my friend in such disorder see,
And all the Marks that he is called to Danger,
To leave him then --

It is a Summons from a Lady, Sir,
Whom I have loved with Passion and Success;
To meet her in her Garden presently:
All is propitious on her part and mine;
But she's so Guarded by a Tyrant Brother,
So Jealous naturally, and so Incensed
By that new Accident I told you of,
Which makes me a close Prisoner all the day;
That to persuade you there no Danger is
In this Adventure, were to abuse you;
But even for that reason I am bound
Not to consent to the Embarking you
In an occasion that's so opposite
To what you come for; Antonio, We must
As well to Friends as to our Selves be just.

He ought not to pretend to Friendships name,
Who reckons not Himself and Friend the same.

Friendship with Justice must not disagree,
That were to break the Virtue's Harmony.

Who in his Friends Distresses takes no part,
His Friendship's only in his Tongue, not Heart.

You from a life of Perils hither come
To find a Nuptial Bed, not seek a Tomb.

My Friend engaged, it never must be said,
Antonio left him so to go to Bed.

Y are marri'd, and expose what's not your own.

Wedded to Honour, that must yield to none.

I find, Antonio, you must still subdue.

I ow my Triumph to my Cause, not You.
Come, we lose time, your Mistress must not stay.

Who's so accompani'd, needs not fear his way.

COme, Cozin, the hour assigned approaches.

Nay, more than so, for 'tis already night.

And thanks to your Stars sufficiently dark.

To the Clouds you would say, Flora, for Stars,
In this occasion, would not much befriend us.
Pray, Cozin, when Octavio shall arrive,
Do you and Flora watch above with care;
For if my cruel Brother should surprise us --

Let us alone to play the Sentinels.

I'm confident he's abroad, and will not
Suddenly return; for I heard him say,
He'd pass th'Evening at the Corigidors;
And thence, you know, he seldom comes home early.

Is it not something early for Adventures Of this Nature?

'Tis the Hour she appointed.

How dark 'tis grown o'th'sudden, there's not one
Star appears in all the Firmament.

So much the better; for when I must fight,
I covet no Spectators of my Prowess.

Stay you here, Antonio, I'll step before,
And give the Sign; when you here the door open,
Then come on, and follow me in.

The Corigidors is a pretty place.

The Walks do so entice me, I always
Weary my self, before I can retire.

Indeed we have staid longer than we thought,
And therefore let's go home the shorter way;
The back door of my Garden's here at hand.

It will be better than to go about.

Would he were come,
Will give us little time.

I think I hear his usual Knock;

'Tis I.

I hope you're not alone.

No; here's Diego with me, and a Friend.

'Tis well; I'll open the door presently.

Come;

Let's to the door; sure she's there by this time;
Be not afraid Diego.

Agree that with him that made me, who has Given me a Heart no bigger than my
Thumb;
You'd as good command me not to Breath.

Come on; what art thou thinking on?

That I see Company, or that my Fear does

Y' are in the right;
Walk on at large, till they are out of distance.

I think I heard your Garden door open.

I think so too; Ha! at this time of the night?
What can be the meaning on it? 'Tis so.

They have opened the door; 'tis time for me
To follow, surely Octavio is gone in.

What stay you for?

What's that I hear? sure 'tis Porcia's voice.

What mean you to stand there? come in, I say.

Hell and Furies!

Be patient,

You may come in securely, Octavio:
I have set those will watch my Brothers coming.

Madam, I am not Octavio.

Not Octavio? who are you then? and who's
That Shadow there?

I can hold no longer;
Vile Woman, and his Mortal Enemy.

Ha! my Mortal Enemy?

Yes, Villain; who ere thou art, thou shalt pay
This Treachery with thy Life.

Vain Man; who ere thou art, know, the Life thou
Threaten'st, is Guarded by too good a Sword.

Make fast the door.

Thou art some desperate Villain hired to murder.

Hired by Friendship, and Honor's my Salary.

That's Antonio's voice within the Garden;
What! the door shut! my Friend engaged, and I
Excluded! cursed Fate! this Tree may help me
To climb over; if not, I'll fly to him.

You may do so; your noble Love has Wings,
And's ever Fledge;
Yet I'll up too; the hazards not in climbing,
Here I will so, and out of dangers reach
Expect the Issue.

Courage, brave Friend; you have Octavio by you.

So Seconded, a Coward would grow firm.

What! is there more of your crew? then 'tis time
To call for help; Ho! Sylvio, Geraldo,
Pedro, come forth; and bring out Torches with you.

Here am I, Sir; my Camerades will follow
As soon as they have lighted their Torches.

How I despise these Slaves Octavio,
Having you by me!

Their Swords do clatter bravely in the dark.

I'm slain.

Good; that's Sylvio's voice; I have owed that Fellow
A Good-turn this Twelve-month for a Mistake,
Breaking my Head, when he should have Broke a Jest;
Now he's paid.

What! are you hurt?

No, only I fell; Help me to find my Sword.

What? do you give back? you do well to take breath,
Whilst you have any left;
Now that the Rising Moon lends us some light.

O Octavio! let not this moment slip
To Free me from my cruel Brother's Fury,
Or never hope to see me any more
Amongst the living.

Ah! Noble Maid, he that is once possessed
Of such a Treasure, and safe-guards it not,
Let him live Wretched, and Detested die;
Where's my brave Friend?

You have me by your side, lead off your Mistress,
I'll secure your Retreat.

That doubtless is my Master, who victorious
Is bravely marching off with his fair Prize;
I'll down, and follow, inventing all the way
Some handsome Lie t'excuse my Cowardice;
Why lived not I five thousand years ago,
Being ne'er made for this damned Iron Age?

But whilst my care led me to succour you,
Our Enemies, I fear, are got away;
I heard the door open, and see none here,
Although the Night's much brighter grown than twas*
I'll follow, and trace the Villains if I can
To their Dens; mean while take care of your Sister;
And (pray) till my return be Moderate.

How! Moderation in this case! what ho!
Geraldo, Pedro, ah ye cursed Rogues,
Durst ye not show your heads till they were gone?
Geraldo, light me in, whilst Pedro looks
To his hurt Companion; ah Porcia! Porcia!

Sure, Antonio bringing up the Rear;
Sir, they are but just before us; he bears her
Most gallantly away; lose not sight of me.

This Fellow takes me for one of his Crew;
He will by his mistake help me to harbour 'em.

Was there ever such a Disaster, Flora?
Sure, they are all dead, so great's the Silence.

Madam, if mistake not very much,
I heard your Brother's voice amongst 'em.

Ah! my dear Brother, how thy ill-plac'd Friendship
Upon that Brutal Kinsman has abused
Thy Goodness; though my Natural affection
Moves me, Flora, to Pity him in Danger,
Yet my Concernment for my Cozin Porcia
Does prevail at present; Porcia, Porcia;
No body answers.

Madam, let us go down into the Garden.

Take heed of that; 'twere to involve my self
In this unlucky Scandal; 'tis possible,
Affrighted with the Scuffle, she's returned
Into her Quarter by the other door;
Let us hast thither.

Oh! Madam, I see a Light, and Don Henrique
Coming this way with his Sword drawn, what shall
We do?

Peace;
Till we discover his Intentions.

Sir, I have searched all the Rooms of the House,
And cannot find her.

Base Infamous Woman; may be she's fled
To the Quarter ordered for Antonio.

That door is locked, his Servant has the Key.

Ah this unworthy Woman! thus to rob
A Brother of the Fruits of all his Care;
And cast this Stain on the Honour of our House;
But if I ever get the Fugitive
Within my reach, I'll Sacrifice her Blood
To the Offended Spirits of my Ancestors.

Madam, d you hear?

I, and tremble, Flora.

Call out for her Woman.

Flora, Flora.

My good Angel Guard me; what would you have Sir?

Where's your Mistress, Hussy?

She told me, Sir, about half an hour since
She would go down into the Garden.

My Shame is certain; ah! the sad condition
Of us Men of Honour! how unequally
Our Crosses and our Comforts mingled are!
Our Orphan Sisters are no sooner grown
Above the Follies of their Childish Age;
During which Season Custom does exact
Our Watchful Caution over all their Actions;
But they are Grafted on some Stranger Stock,
Where they do change both their Aboads, and Names,
Without Reflection in the least Degree
Of Gratitude, on those, who Pained themselves
To Cultivate their Youths; or else become
An Hourly Torture to us, whilst the best
Continued in our Care do never cease
To give the Fears at least of what I feel.
O unjust Heavens! why suffer you that they,
Who to our Joys of Life such Bubbles are,
Should add such Weight unto our Griefs, and Care?
Ah Porcia, Porcia!

Cozin, I'm much mistaken, or I have
In very Little time made a Great Progress
Towards your Revenge; I come from harbouring
The Villains, who have done you this Affront.

It imports to be attentive now.

Oh, you revive me, may I but once enjoy
The Pleasure of my Revenge, though the next
Moment were the last Period of my Life,
I should depart contented; are the Villains
Within our reach?

Be patient, Sir, and I'll inform you fully;
You were no sooner up, but I pursued
Your flying Enemies, hoping the night
Grown somewhat Lighter, would enable me
(At a convenient distance) to discover
The place of their Retreat; one of their Party,
Who was behind the rest, mistaking me
For one of his Camerades, bad me come on;
Saying his Master was but just before;
That he had born his Mistress bravely off.
We had not past above a Street or two,
Before he stopped, and at the second House
Beyond the Church in St. Iago's Street,
He entered, and desired me to follow him;
I making a stand, he grew suspicious,
And from my Silence guessing his Mistake,
He slipped into the House, and locked the door;
I having well observed the street and House,
Returned with speed to give you this account.

Oh, Madam, this is Don Octavio's House;
Without all doubt they've carried Porcia thither.

Peace, Flora, and listen to the sequel.

Come, Cozin; we loose time; call all my Servants;
I will besiege the House; if they refuse
To render; I will reduce that Theater
Of my Shame to Ashes, and make their Fort
Both Theirs and its own Sepulchre; There are
Such Charms in Vengeance, that I do not wonder,
It is reserved for him, who formed the Thunder.

Have patience, Cozin, and consult your Reason;
'Twill soon convince you, how Unpracticable
And Vain your Proposition is, t'attempt
At this time of the night, within a City,
A House so Guarded, That, indeed, would prove
Very like Thunder, which the Cloud destroys
Wherein 'twas formed, producing only Noise.
What can the Issue be, but to Alarm
The Town; expose your Person, and your Fortune
To the Rigour of the Law; publish your Shame;
And frustrate your Revenge for ever?

What! would you have me tarry till these Villains,
Who have invaded my House; Affronted
My Person; Murdered my Servant; and Robbed
Me of a Sister; may evade my Vengeance?

No; fear not that; let me alone to find
A certain way to hinder their escape;
I'll instantly to the Corrigidors,
And beg th'assistance of his Authority,
To secure these Criminals for the present,
That afterwards the Law may punish them.

A fine Proposal! why, Cozin, can you think
That I'll submit a Personal Injury
Unto a tame Decision of the Law?
And having been Affronted by the Sword,
To pray the Aid of the Long Robe, and take
An Advocate for Second?

Your Provocation's great, Resentment's just;
But, Cozin, the Greater they, the More you stand
In need of Moderation, and th'Advice
Of such a Friend, as you have always found me;
Nor can I ever express it more than now,
In freely telling you, you must not suffer
Your Passion to Command in this Occasion;
Passion, which wheresoever it contends
To Govern most, there most Destroys its Ends.

Oh! how I hate your dry Morality!
To treat a Friend with Sentences, that's raging
In a Fever; you may as well pretend
To teach a Man to Sing his Part, that's stretched
Upon a Rack; no, Sir, I'll sooner die,
Than ere consent to publish my Disgrace,
Before I have Revenged it.

'Tis far from my intent; all my design
Is only how we may Conceal your Shame,
Till we have got these Villains in our Power.
Which can be brought about by no such means,
As by demanding Justice against those,
Who did assault your Person, and have slain
Your Servant; a most plausible pretence.
Will this content you? trust my Conduct Cozin;
Is not my Interest the same with yours?

Well, since it must be so, I pray make haste.

Doubt not my diligence; by this I'll prove
Friendship has Fire, and Wings as well as Love.

If you could F^e, you'd move with too much Leisure;
Ah tedious Minutes which Revenge does measure!

Madam, y'have heard their mischievous design.

Yes, Flora, out of question Porcia's there;
And if they find her, she is lost forever.

I'll try to Hinder it, though I were sure
To Perish in the attempt; I am confident,
The House at present is in such confusion,
I may run thither without being missed.

'Tis well thought on; in the interim I'll retire
To Porcia's Chamber.

Sir, Don Antonio is just now arrived.

Ha! what's that you say Sirrha?

That Don Antonio, Sir, your Brother-in-law
Is without, walking in the Hall, and bad me
Give you notice of it, shall he come in?

Antonio arrived! O Heavens! this Circumstance
Alone was wanting to complete my Shame.
When he desires to See his Wife, shall I
My self inform so generous a Person
That she is Run away? where shall I find
A Heart, a Tongue, a Voice, or Breath, or Face
To utter this unparallel^d Disgrace?

What is your pleasure, Sir? Don Antonio
May think it long.

Wait on him in, but at the same time tell him
You cannot find me; I will leave my House,
And the discovery of my Shame to Fate;
And any Censure rather undergo,
Than be Relater of my own Disgrace;
Till first I have my Honor's Ransom paid
In the Vile Blood of that perfidious Maid.

My Friend and his fair Mistress safely lodged,
And free from their Adventure; 'tis now fit
To mind my own Engagement; But Ernesto,
What can the meaning be of this indecent
Suffering me to remain without thus long
Upon my first Arrival? come, let's go on
Into the other Rooms.

I swear, Sir, I'm amazed at this great change;
'Tis not above two hours, since I found here
A numerous and well-order'd Family,
In all appearance, now I see the Pages
Bolt out of the doors, then start back again
Into their holes, like Rabbits in a Warren;
The Maids lie peeping at the Garret windows,
Like th'Upper Tire of Ordinance in a Ship;
All looks disordered now; nor can I guess
What may have caused so strange an alteration;
But there I see the Servant you sent in.

Friend, where's your Master?

I cannot tell, Sir.

Where is his Sister?

In truth I know not, Sir; we Men-servants
Have little to do in the Ladies Quarters.

This looks but oddly; are you sure Ernesto,
Y'have not misguided me to a wrong House?

If you are certain that we are awake,
Then I am certain this is the same House
Wherein this afternoon I saw, and spoke with
Don Henrique and your Bride; by the same Token
There was a Lady with her in a Veil;
And this very Room is the Ante-chamber
To her Apartment.

I should be finely served, if after all
This Negotiation, and a tedious Journey,
My Pains and Patience should be cast away
On some such withered Sybil for a Wife,
As her own Brother is ashamed to show me.

You'll soon be freed from that fear, Sir.

How so?

Because I see her in the Inner Room,
Lying along upon her Couch, and Reading;
Her face is turned the other way, but yet
Her Shape, and Clothes assure me it is she.

Art sure 'tis she?

There are not many like her.

If thou be sure 'tis she, I'll venture in,
Without her Brother's help to introduce me.

She's coming this way, Sir.

Y'have reason, Dido, and 'tis well remarqu'd,
The Woman, who suffers her self to Love,
Ought likewise to prepare her self to Suffer;
There was great Power in your Charms, Aeneas,
T'enthrall a Ladies heart at first approach,
And make such early and such deep Impressions,
That nothing, but her death, could ere deface.
Alas! poor Dido!

What do I see;
Sure I am asleep; and 'tis a Vision
Of her, who's always present to my Thought;
Who fearing my Revolt does now Appear
To Prove and to Confirm my Constancy.
When first I saw that Miracle, she seemed
An Apparition, here it must be one.

What fit of Frenzy's this, Sir? why 'tis Porcia*
A Lovely Living Woman, and your Bride.

The Blessing is too mighty for my Faith.

Faith! ne'er trouble your Faith in this occasion,
Approach her boldly, Sir, and trust your Sense.

As when we dream of some Transporting Pleasure,
And finding that we Dream we fear to Wake,
Lest Sense should rob us of our Fancie's Treasure,
And our Delightful Vision from us take;
Blessed Apparition, so it fares with me.
That very Angel does once more appear,
To whose Divinity long since I raised
An Altar in my Heart, where I have Offered
The constant Sacrifice of Sighs and Vows.
My eyes are open, yet I dare not trust 'em;
Bliss above Faith must pass for an Illusion;
If such it be, O let me sleep for ever
Happily deceived; but Celestial Maid,
If this thy glorious Presence Real be,
O let one word of Pity raise my Soul
From Visional Delights, and make me die
With Solid Joy instead of Ecstasy.

'Slife! he's in one of his old Fits again;
Why what do you mean, Sir? 'tis Porcia herself.

I am that Maid, who to your Virtue owes
Her Honour then, and her Disquiet since;
Yet in my Pain I cannot but be Pleased
To find a Stronger Passion justifi'd
By Obligation; I may avow the Fire,
To which both Love and Gratitude conspire.

Incomparable Creature! can it be?
That having Suffered all, which mighty Love
Did ever inflict, I now should be repaid
With fuller Joys, than Love could ever give;
Fortune to make my Happiness complete,
Has joined her Power, and made me find a Bride
In a Lost Mistress, but with this Allay,
Of leaving me no Means my Faith to prove,
Since Chance anticipates the Hopes of Love.

The Servant's Error has misled the Master,
He takes me too for Porcia, blessed Mistake;
Assist me now Artful Dissimulation;
But how can that consist with so much Passion?
'Tis possible the Sense of my Distressed
Condition might dispose a Gentle heart
To take Impressions then, which afterwards
Time, and your Second Thoughts may have Destroyed;
But can a Constant Passion be produced
From those Ideas Pity introduced?
Let your Tongue speak your Heart, for should y'abuse me,
I shall in time discover the Deceit;
You may Paint Fire; Antonio, but not Heat.

Madam --

Hold; be not too Scrupulous, Antonio;
Let me Believe it, though it be not True;
For the chief Happiness, poor Maids receive,
Is when our Selves we happily Deceive.

If, since I first those Conquering Eyes beheld,
You have not reigned Unrivaled in my Heart;
May you Despise me now you are my Own,
Which is, I think, all Curses summed in one.
But may your Servant, Madam, take the boldness
To ask, if you have ever thought of him?

A Love, so founded in a Noble Heart,
Has need of no Remembrancer, Antonio;
You know your self too well; those of your Trade
Have skill to Hold, as well as to Invade.

Fortune has lifted me to such a Height
Of Happiness, that it may Turn my Brain,
When I look down upon the rest of the world.
What have I now to wish but Moderation
To Temper, and to Fix my Joys?

I yield as little t'you, noble Antonio,
In Happiness, as Affection, but still
Porcia must do as may become your Bride,
And Sister to Don Henrique, in whose absence
A longer Conference must be excused.
And so I take the freedom to withdraw.

Should I have staid until Don Henrique came,
His presence would have marred my whole design.

Where Beauty and Discretion so combine,
'Tis Heaven, me-thinks, to find that Treasure mine.

Sure Don Antonio, having long ere this
Found out the infamous Flight of my vile Sister,
Will be retired to meditate Revenge
Upon us both: ah Curse! he is there still;
I'll slip away; but, O Heavens! 'tis too late,
He has perceived me.

How, Don Henrique! avoid your Friend? that's come
So long a Journey t'embrace you, and cast
Himself at the feet of your fair Sister?

Noble Antonio, you may well imagine
The trouble I am in, that you should find
My House in such Disorder, so unfit
The Honour to receive of such a Guest.

'Tis true, Don Henrique, I am much surprised
With what I find; I little did expect
Your Sister Porcia should have been --

Oh Heavens!
'Tis not, Antonio, in a Brothers power
To make a Sister of a better Paste,
Than Heaven has made her.

In your case specially; for out of doubt,
Heaven never made a more Accomplished Creature.

What means the Man?

I come just now from Entertaining her:
Whose Wit, and Beauty so excel all those
Of her fair Sex, whom I have ever known,
That my Description of her would appear
Rather Detraction, than a Just Report
Of her Perfections.

Certainly he mocks me; he never could
Have chosen a worse Sufferer of Scorn;
But I will yet contain my self awhile
To see how far he'll drive it; Say you, Sir,
That you have Seen, and Entertained my Sister?

Yes, Don Henrique, and with such full Contentment,
So raised above Expression, that I think
The Pains, and Cares of all my former Life
Rewarded with Excess, in the Delight
Of those few Minutes of her Conversation;
'Tis true, that Satisfaction was abridged
By her well-weigh'd Severity; to give me
A greater Pleasure in the Contemplation
Of her discreet Observance of the Rules
Of Decency; not suffering me, though now
Her Husband, any longer to enjoy
So great a Happiness, you being absent.

I am confounded;
My Astonishment, till I can unfold
The Mystery; She might have spared that Caution,
But I suppose you'll easily Forgive
An Error on the Better side.

Sir, I have seen so much of her Perfections
In that short Visit, I shall sooner doubt
All Definitions in Morality,
Than once suppose her capable of Error.

This Exposition makes it more Obscure:
I must get him away. Sir, is't not time
I bring you to your Chamber? it is late,
And I believe that you have need of Rest.

I should accept your offer, were I not
Obliged, as late as 'tis, to see a Friend
Before I go to Bed.

I'll wait on you, Sir, if you I give me leave.

I humbly thank you, Sir, but can't consent
To give you so much trouble; I'll return
Within an hour at farthest.

When ever you please; you're wholly Master here.

I never saw a man so Discomposed,
What ever the matter is.
Ernesto, I must make a step to see
A Friend near hand; bid Sancho follow me;
And stay you in my Chamber till I come.

Your Servant,
At this time of the night, and newly arrived
From a long Journey, does embroil me more.
But now I will not long be in Suspense;
I'll to my Sister's Chamber.

Ho Don Henrique, there is haste required; all's
Prepared, and if the Quarry lodged shall prove
Worthy of our own Swords, we may employ them;
If not, the Sword of Justice shall revenge
Our Injuries; for the Corrigidor
Is ready with a Band of Sergeants.

Speak softly; Don Antonio is arrived,
And some of his may over-hear us.

That's very unlucky, but does he know
That Porcia's missing?

I think not yet.

Come, let's away; we have no time to lose.

Pray stay awhile; I labour with a Doubt
Will burst me if not cleared before I go.

What Cozin! will you loose an Opportunity
Never to be recovered? are you mad?
Will you permit the Villains to escape,
And laugh at us for ever? come away.

Well, I must go; and let time make it out;
The worst Estate of Human Life is Doubt.

VIllain, thou hast undone us, cursed Villain;
Where was thy Soul, had Fear quite Banished it?
And left thee not one grain of common Sense?

Was there ever so fatal an Accident?

Why, Traitor, did thou not let me know it,
As soon as we were come into the House?

What would y' have done if ye had known it then?

I would have fally'd out, and Killed the Rogue,
In whose Power thou hast put it to Destroy us;
Can it be doubted, but that long ere this
He has acquainted Henrique where we are?
From whose black Hage we must immediately
Expect to encounter all the pernicious
Effects of Malice, backed by Seeming Justice;
Curse on all Cowards! better far be served
By Fools, and Knaves: they make less dangerous Faults.

Am I in fault, because I'm not a Cat?
How could I tell in the dark whether that Rascal
Was a Knight Errant, or a Recreant Knight?
I thought him one of us, and true to Love;
Were it not for such Accidents as these
That mock Man's Fore-cast, sure the Destinies
Had ne'er been placed amongst the Deities.

Peace, cowardly Slave; having thus plaid the Rogue,
Art thou Sententious grown? did I not Fear
To Stain my Sword with such Base Blood, I'd let
Thy Soul out with it at a thousand wounds.

Why then a thousand Thanks to my Base Blood
For saving my Good Flesh.

Pardon, my dearest Mistress, this Excess
Of Passion in your presence.

What shall we do Octavio? we are lost
For ever; if we should stay here, my Brother
Will be upon us instantly. Alas!
My own Life I value not Octavio,
Where yours, my Better life, such hazard runs;
But O my Honour! O my Innocence!
Exposed to Scandal; there's my deepest Sense.

Though the Complexion of your Brother's Malice.
Resemble Hell, it is not Black enough
To cast a Stain upon your Virgin Whiteness.
As Contraries compared set off each other,
The sister's Brightness will expose the Brother.

O my Octavio! he is still my Brother;
But what do you resolve to do?

I must resolve and suddenly, but what
I swear know not, there have been such Turns
In my Misfortunes, they have made me giddy.

You must determine, time wastes Octavio.

If I should lead you through the Streets, and meet
Th'in quisitive Justice, I daring not
T'avow my self upon the other score
You know of, you might that way be in danger;
We must not venture 't;
A Chair immediately.

A pretty Errand at this time of the night;
These Chair-men are exceedingly well natured,
They are likely to obey a Servant's Orders
After ten a clock.

Ye Powers above, why do ye lay so great
A Weight on Human Nature, and bestow
Such an Unequal Force to bear our Loads?
After a long pursuit through all those Storms,
Which Hell-bred Malice, or the Power of Fate
Could ever raise, t'oppose a Noble Love;
To be at length posse s'd of the Rich Mine,
Where Nature seemed to have lodged all her Treasure;
And in an instant have it ravished from me,
Is too rude a Trial for my tired Patience
To su^ain; I cannot bear it.

My Sense of this Misfortune Equals yours,
But yet I must conjure you to submit
To Heavens Decrees; such Resignation
'Tis possible, their Justice may induce
The mischief to divert, though ne'er so near.

Ah Porcia to part with you!

Loose not your self with me, though we are forced
To Separate, yet we are not Divorced.

Whilst our Souls act by Organs of the Sense,
'Twixt Death and Parting there's no difference.

Consult your Reason, then you will comply;
Making a Virtue of Necessity.

Ah lovely Maid, 'twas not allow'd to Jove
To hold at once his Reason, and his Love.

The Chair is come, Sir, just as I expected.

Where is it?

Even where it was; they are deeply engaged
At New Cut, and will not leave their Game,
They swear, for all the Dons in Sevil.

A curse upon these Rogues! I'll make 'em come,
Or put some of 'em in a condition
To be carried themselves.

Madam, though I was never yet Unkind
To my own Person, I am so much troubled
At the Disquiet my Mistake has brought you,
That could I do it conveniently, i'faith,
I could even cudgel my self.

Away Buffon, is this a time for fooling?

Where is my noble Friend Octavio?

Did you not meet him at the door, Sir?

No.

He went out just as you came in.

Madam,
To Rest, without returning to enquire
Anew of Yours, and of my Friends Condition;
And once more offer you my Service.

I take the boldness in Octavio's absence
To return his with my most humble Thanks
For your late generous Assistance of us,
And for this new Addition to our Debt.

Madam, though I have not the Happiness
To be Known to you, yet my constant Friendship
With Octavio is of an ancient Date;
And all Occasions where I may express
The Fervour of it, are most welcome to me.

O Madam -- I'm out of breath with running.

What Accident, Flora, brings you hither?

A sad one, Madam, and requiring haste,
To give you timely notice on it; Don Carlos,
Assisted by the light of the Rising Moon,
And by a Mistake of some of your Train,
Has Traced you to this House, and in my hearing,
Informed your Brother of the Place, and Manner
Of your Retreat, who is now coming hither
Accompani'd with the Corigidor,
To seize on whomsoever shall be found
Within these Walls, upon pretence of Murder.

O cruel Accident!

Madam, make haste, get out at the back door;
Or you will certainly be met withal.

How vile a Creature am I now become!
For though in my own Innocence secure,
As to my self, t'others I shall appear
Some wicked Woman, that has sold her Honour
To purchase Infamy.

They'll instantly be here.

O that Octavio should just now be absent!
But to expect till he return were madness.

Y' have reason, Madam, and if you dare trust
Your Person to the Conduct of a Stranger,
Upon my Honour, Lady, I'll Secure you,
Or Perish in th'Attempt.

Generous Sir, how shall a wretched Maid,
Abandoned by her Fare to the pursuit
Of an Inhumane Brother, e'rbe able
Either to Merit, or Requite your Favours?

Madam, they're more than Paid in the Admission,
And your Acceptance of them will transfer
The Obligation, making me the Debtor.

To your Protection I resign my self,
With equal Gratitude and Confidence.

Come Madam, there is no time to be lost;
Diego, find out your Master presently,
And tell him, that the Danger not allowing
Our Stay till his Return, I shall convey
His Mistress safely to a Nunnery.

And Flora, stay you here to bring me word,
What he resolves to do in this our desperate Condition.

Madam, I shall.

But stay;
A foul Mistake; the Monastery Gates
Will not be opened at this time of Night,
Without a strict Inquiry into the Cause;
Besides, 'tis possible, that once Lodged there,
She may be out of my Friends Power, or mine,
Ever to get her thence if it be known.
Lady, I have thought better on it; I shall
Conduct you to my Brother-in-law's house;
A Person of such Quality, and Honour,
As is fit to engage in your Protection;
And there my Wife may have the Happiness
To accompany you, and pay the Offices
Due to your Virtue, and distressed Condition:
And going to a House that's so much mine,
Make account, Madam, 'tis to your own Home.
Sancho, stay you here to attend Octavio,
And guide him the next way to my Apartment;
Here is the Key; I shall have little use on it,
Having left Ernesto waiting for me there.
One word more, Sancho; let Octavio know
'Tis my advice that he come in a Chair;
He by that means may escape Examination,
Should he be met with.

Flora, I pray do you continue here,
And if by any accident Octavio
Should hindered be from coming after us,
Observe his Motions, and where he Fixes;
Then return home; and I shall find some way
Of sending to you to inform my self.

I shall not fail t'observe your Orders, Madam.

Madam, I'm ready to wait on you.

An cruel Brother! ah my dear Octavio!
O how perverse, and rigorous is my Fate!
Thus to torment me betwixt Love and Hate.

'Tis no small Compliment my Master makes
Your Lady, and her Gallant, at this time
Of the night to quit his Brother-in-laws, and leave
So fair a Bride as Porcia all alone.

What? is his Mistris's name Porcia too?

Yes; and if she has but as fair a Hand-maid
As your self, I shall soon forget my Damsel
In the Low-countries.

If your Low-country Damsels resemble us,
You would not be put to it to forget first;
But I believe that you are safe enough;
I have not heard such Praises of their Wit,
But that we may suppose they have good Memories.

Is not my Master yet returned?

No.

Well; now have we an Honourable Cause
To wear the Beadles Livery; faith, Flora,
If your tender Sex had not been privileged
From this harsh Discipline, how prettily
Would the Beadles Crimson Lace show upon
Thy white back.

'T won't do so well as on a darker ground;
'Twill suit much better with your Tawny hide.

I pray, Camerade, is it the Mode in Sevil
To be Whipped for Company?

Oh! a well-bred Soldier will ne'er refuse
Such a Civility to an old Friend;
This is a new way of being a Second,
To show your Passive Courage.

We Soldiers do not use to show our Backs.

Not to your Enemies; but, Sir, the Beadle
Will prove your Friend, for your Blood being Heated
With your long Journey, Breathing of a Vein
Is very requisite.

Would to Heaven that I were in the Camp again:
There we are never stripped till we are dead.

Be sure you stir not thence till I return.
Sirrha, where's Porcia?

She's fled away i'th'dark, with a Young man Of your acquaintance.

Rascal, leave your fooling.

There's none in the case, Sir, 'tis the wisest thing
She ever did, had she staid your return,
She would have fallen into those very Clutches,
In which you will immediately be grip'd,
Unless you make more haste: Flora is come
With all possible speed, to let you know
They are coming with the Justice to lay hold
Of all within this House, upon pretence
Of a most horrid Murder; be quick, Sir;
And save your self. She's safe in a Nunnery;
Conducted thither by Antonio;
Where, poor Lady, she's dropping for you now
More Beads, perhaps, than Tears.

Peace Screetch-Owl; Fire consume that Tongue of thine.
What say thou Villain? in a Nunnery?
Porcia in a Nunnery? O Heavens! nothing
But this was wanting to make me Desperate;
What hope's there left ever to get her thence,
After such Accidents as these made Public?
Ah Flora, is it true that my dear Porcia
Is gone into a Monastery?

Once, Sir, 'twas so resolved, and Diego sent
To give you notice on it; but afterwards
He being gone, they changed their Resolutions:
There's one can tell you more --

My Master bad me stay to let you know
He has conveyed her to his own Apartment,
In his Brother-in-laws House, a person
So eminent in Quality, and Credit,
That the engaging him in her, and your
Protection, Sir, may much avail you both;
Besides, she'll have the pleasure there of being
Very well treated by my Master's Bride.
There he'll expect you, Sir, and does advise
Your coming in a Chair, to avoid Question
In case of any Encounter.

And my walking by, Sir, as an Attendant,
Will pass you without scruple for a Lady.

I'll take his counsel, he's a generous Friend,
Come Chair-men, away.

Up with your Burden Beasts, and fall forth-with
To your Half-Trot.

A Noise within, Follow, follow, follow.
This is one of Don Cupid's pretty Jeasts.
We're struck upon a Shelf before we could
Put out to Sea.

Oh, we are undone Diego!

You find,

What are you, Sirrha?

A Living Creature, very like a Man,
Only I want a Heart.

You're pleasant, Sir, pray Heaven your mirth continue.
Who is that Woman with the Veil?

Let her answer for her self, sh'has a Tongue,
Set it but once a going, and she'll tell
All that she knows, and more.

Make her discover her face.

Hold Friend; Cozin, if it should be Porcia,
'Twere not fit to expose her here.

'Tis very well considered, go you to her,
And speak to her in private.

'Tis I Sir, Flora, who being commanded
By my Lady --

Speak softly prithee Flora, 'tis enough;
I understand the rest, and pity her;
Bid her sit still in the Chair, I'll do my best
To save her from the Fury of her Brother.

He thinks 'tis Porcia there, a good Mistake,
It may secure Octavio for the present
From the hands of this rude Rabble;
They take you for my Mistress Sir, I'll follow
The Chair, and have a watchful Eye on all
Occasions, that may further your Escape.

We have found our wandering Nymph.

Is it Porcia her self?

No, 'tis her Woman Flora following
The Chair, wherein they were conveying her
To some other place.

We arrived luckily, had we but staid
A moment longer, they had all been fled.

Will you have us see, Sir, who's in the Chair?

Forbear Fellow!
Enough't'a Woman of her Quality,
Without our adding that of Public shame.

'Twas luckily thought on, when you obliged
Don Henrique to expect us at your House;
For had he come, and found his Sister thus,
'T had not been possible to have restrained
His Passion from some great Extravagance.

I could not think it fit to let him come;
For one of such a Spirit could ne'er brook
The sight of those had done him these Affronts,
Without invading those strict Rules, which might
Render his Life obnoxious to the Laws.
'Tis better that a business of this nature,
(Chiefly 'twixt Persons of such Quality)
Should rather be reduced by Mediation
(If it be possible) to some fair Agreement,
Than to a public Trial by the Law,
Or, which is worse, some Barbarous Revenge.

This Fellow (if I am not much mistaken)
Is Don Octavio's Man.

Who do you belong too, Friend?

To no body, Sir.

Do not you serve?

Yes Sir, but my Master is not himself.

Take his Sword from him Sergeant.

Diego disarmed by any other hand
Than by his own? know Friend, it is a Weapon
Of such dire Execution, that I dare not
Deliver it, but to the hands of Justice.

Signior, pray call for it, when you come home,
And hanged up in your Hall, then under-write,
This is bold Diego's Sword; O may it be
Ever from Rust, as 'tis from Slaughter free.

Thou art a Fellow of a pleasant humour.

Signior, I never pain my self for Love,
Or Fame, or Riches, nor do I pretend
To that great subtilty of Sense to Feel
Before I am Hurt, and for the most part
I keep my self out of Harms way.

The Definition of a Philosopher.

Come, leave your fooling Sirrha, wher's your Master?

I am afraid we are not to be parted.

Whom do you mean?

My Master, my Self, and the Fool your Worship
Mentions, for sure one that had any Wit,
Would never serve a Lover Militant;
He had better wait upon a Mountebank,
And be run through the Body twice a week
To recommend his Balsom.

This Fellow's an Original.

But of so ill a hand, I am not worth
The hanging up, Sir, in my Masters room,
Amongst the worst of your Collection.

An't please your Worship, we have searched the House,
From the Cellars to the Garrits, and these are all
The living Cattle we can find.

Friends take a special care of that same Varlet,
And the Waiting-woman; we will find a way
To make them tell the Truth, I warrant you.

O Diego! must we be Prisoners together?

Why, that's not so bad as the Bands of Wedlock,
Flora.

Come, let's away; but whither to convey her --
To her own House certainly were not fit,
Because of her incensed Brother.

If you approve it, Cozin, I'll carry her
To mine; for since we seek (if possible)
The business to compose, she will be there
With much more Decency, and Satisfaction,
And less exposed to Censure of the World,
Being in a Kinsmans House, and having there
My Sister to accompany her.

This business cannot be in better hands,
Than yours; and there I'll leave it, and bid you
Good-night.

Your Servant Cozin,
Cozin, you may be please to take your Sergeants
Along with you; there are without two Servants
Belonging to Don Henrique, they'll suffice
To guard our Prisoners, and with far less notice.

Come Sergeants, follow me.

Well,
I'll not be troubled with ye; I am glad
We did not find Octavio here; though I
Might unaffected Ignorance pretend,
I would not bring him (though by chance) t'his End.

Well, I am now sufficiently instructed,
And since there is no notice taken of me,
I'll fairly steal away, and give my Master
Account of this Misfortune.

Take up the Chair, and follow me.

A Lovely Dame they bear, 'tis true, she's something
Hairy, but that's a sign of Strength.

Make haste, I long to let Don Henrique know,
That his lost Sister is by my dexterity
Recovered, and I hope to find some means
To calm his Fury, and to repossess
My Cozin Porcia, and (if it be possible)
Octavio of his good Graces. Come away.

How like an Ass he'll look, when opening the Shell,
His Worship finds within so rough a Kernel.

Madam, banish all your Fears, you are now
Safe in this House; be pleased to remain here,
Till I shall bring some Lights, and acquaint Porcia
With the Honour she receives in entertaining
So fair a Guest.

Who is't you say you will advertise Sir?

My Wife Porcia; have but a little patience;
And she shall wait upon you.

Is her name Porcia too? I pray Heaven send her
A better Fate than her distressed Names-sake.
O Octavio! O Love! how dear do you
Cost me! where am I brought? what House is this?
What with my Fears, and Darkness, I have lost
All my measures; I can't so much as guess
What Quarter of the Town it is we're in,
For to avoid the Encounter of my Brother,
And his Revengeful Train, we have been forced
To make so many Turnings, I am Giddy.
But thanks to Providence I have this comfort,
That I am in a place out of his reach.

Madam, my Wife will presently attend you.
Pardon I pray my absence for a moment.

Now I begin to hope my Sighs, and Tears,
Have in some sort with the just Heavens prevailed
At length to free me --
Am I awake, or is it an Illusion?
Is not this my Brother's House? Is not this
The Quarter joining to my own Apartment?
There is no room for Doubt, and my Misfortunes
Are always Certain; Miserable Creature,
That I should be thus Bandi'd up and down
From one Hazard t'another, greater still.
Ah cruel Heavens! what have I ever done
To deserve this lasting Persecution?
But how came I here? brought by Octavio's friend,
Upon whose Virtue I did so rely
That I my Brothers Malice durst defy.
Can he betray me? sure I am in a Dream.
But if Octavio -- O vile Suspicion!
Octavio false? no, Truth and He are one.
'Tis possible his Friend may guilty be;
But to what end so base a Treachery:
And if Perfidious, how could he be his Friend.
I am confounded with the various forms
Of my Misfortunes, Heightened still the more,
The less I can their Hidden Cause explore.
This onely's evident, that I must fly
Immediately this fatal place; But why
Struggle I thus with Fate? since Go, or Stay,
Death seems alike to wait me every way.

I wonder much what Lady this can be
Antonio mentions.

Pardon, my dearest Mistress, the Liberty
Which I so early take; but I presume
Such is your Generous Tenderness to those,
Whose sad Misfortunes, not their Faults, have driven
Into Distress, that you will think your self
Obliged to him, who gives you the occasion
To exercise those Virtues which do Visit
Others, but Reside with you; This fair Lady --
But she will best relate her own sad Story;
Whilst I seek out Don Henrique, and engage him
Both to Protect and Serve her with his Credit.

Ha! Antonio.
It is not fit Don Henrique, -- but he's gone,
And we are lost for ever.

O Heavens! is this Antonio, the same Man
To whom I am Betrothed? then my Destruction
Is inevitable.

Are you an Apparition? or are you
Porcia her self? speak, that when y' have said it thrice
I may not yet believe you.

You well may Doubt even what you See Camilla;
Since my Disasters are so new, and strange,
They sever Truth from Credibility.

How is it possible you should be here?

I know not how, only of this I'm sure,
I have not long t'expect the dismal end
Of my sad Tragedy; since 'tis evident
The Person that hath led me to this Place,
This fatal Place, is the abused Antonio;
Who with my Cruel Brother has conspired
To take away my wretched life, and chose
This Scene as fittest for their Cruelty.
And thus, strange Fate! (through ignorance betrayed)
I have Protection sought from the same Party,
Whom I have Injured, and have made my Husband
Th'onely Confident of his own Affront:
Who to accomplish his too just Revenge,
As well upon my Family, as Person,
Gives me up to be Murdered by my Brother.
So whilst I'm branded as a Faithless Bride,
He'll be detested as a Particide.

Prodigious Accident! but were thou blind
Not to know thine own House unhappy Porcia?

Alas, how could I in so dark a Night,
In such Confusion, and so full of Fear?
Besides, he brought me in by the Back way,
Through his own Quarter, where was neither Light,
Nor any Creature of the Family.

Although I cannot comprehend the steps
Of this your strange Adventure, yet dear Cozin,
Your case (as I conceive) is not so desperate.

We easily persuade our selves to hope The things we wish; but Cozin, my
condition
Will not admit Self-flattery, and what
Can you propose to temper my Despair?

Don't you remember, how this very Evening
Antonio's Man finding me in your Quarter
Without a Veil (you having put on mine)
That he applied himself to me, and I
By your command, your Person did assume?

Yes very well.

The Master since has by the Man's Mistake
Been happily led into the same Error,
And I not disabus'd him yet, in hopes
It might produce Advantage to us both.

Oh! he has spoken with my Brother since;
Who sure has Undeceived him long ere this.
No, without doubt they having found themselves
Affronted both, have both conspired my death.

How Cozin can that be? if Don Antonio
In your Protection has engaged himself,
And is Octavio's Friend.

Cozin, if you impartially reflect
On the Affront which I have done Antonio,
You will not wonder much if he recede
From the scarce-troden Path of rigid Honour
To meet with his Revenge; and to that end
Proceeds thus cautelously, and does seign
Not to know me, that he may disavow
Both to Octavio, and to all the world,
Th'Infamy of Betraying a poor Maid
To loss of Life and Honour.

Misfortunes make you rave; this vile Suspicion
Is inconsistent with Antonio's Fame:
You may as well believe that Nature will
Reverse the order of the whole Creation,
As that Antonio, a Man, whose Soul
Is of so strong, and perfect a Complexion,
Should ere descend to such a slavish Sin.
And if we had the leisure, I could give you
Such reasons to convince you of your Error,
That you would easily acknowledge it.

I had forgot her near Concernments for
Antonio. Camilla;
My mind is by Afflictions made so Weak,
I'm ready to believe Impossibilities.

I Pity thee with all my heart; but Cozin,
If Antonio not knowing you, nor your
Relations, should chance to find your Brother,
And him inform of what has passed, and that
He has conveyed the distressed Party hither,
He'll presently imagine it is you;
And then (I fear) 'twill be impossible
(Though he should interpose with all his power)
To stop the Torrent, or divert his Rage
From breaking in, and executing on us
That horrid Parricide, which (though too late)
It may be he himself would execrate.

There's too much ground for what you fear Camilla:
But if we could secure our selves this night,
There were some hopes that we tomorrow may
Engage both Don Antonio, and your Brother
To find out some Expedient to redeem me
From this deplorable condition.

Were you only in pain for your Security
This night, I know an easy Remedy
For that.

Which way my Dearest?

Why what does hinder us from making use
(On this occasion) of the secret Door,
By which (you know) you have so often past
Into our House (upon more pleasing Errands?)
By this we shall these Benefits obtain;
Of Safety from your Brothers present Fury,
And time to try if Carlos, and Antonio
May be engaged to mediate in this Business.
And I have cause to think you will not find
Antonio so implacable, as you
Imagine.

I conceive you Cozin; Fool that I was,
To think a Heart once Conquered by your Eyes
Should ever become another Virgin's Prize.

So late; a Guest in's House; that's come so far;
On such a Business; and not yet come home?
There's something in it I cannot comprehend.
I cannot, Madam, yet find out your Brother,
But sure 'twill not be long ere he return.
Then i'll acquaint him with the Accident
Has made his House this Lady's Sanctuary.

Here is a glimpse of comfort, for I see
He takes my Cozin for Don Henrique's Sister;
O blessed Mistake so luckily continued!

I am by his permission Mistress here,
And since that I am pleased Sir, 'tis enough,
Without our troubling him with the Account
Of her sad Story.

Yes, Madam, as to th'Excuse, but 'twere fit
He knew it too, that we might serve our selves
Of his Credit in this Lady's Protection.

Though I did promise the Corrigidor
Not to stir from his House, till his return,
Yet I could not obtain it of my self;
I'm so impatient to unfold the Riddle
Of Don Antonio's seeing of my Sister,
And entertaining her in her own Lodging;
I shall not now be long in the dark.
'Tis she her self, and Camilla with her:
Were all my Servants mad, or all agreed
T'abuse me, in affirming she was fled?
But Don Carlos, was he mad too, to swear
That he had traced her to an other House?
Certainly I, or they must be Possessed;
Or some Enchantment reigns within these Walls.

O here comes Don Henrique, I'll now acquaint him
With your sad Story Madam.

I fear we are undone.

Don Henrique --

I'm dead if he proceed, but how to hinder him --

Here's a Lady with your Sister Porcia --

Yes, Sir, I see who 'tis.

Since you know her Sir, you will the eas'lier
Excuse my boldness.

Boldness, in what Sir?

To have been the occasion of your finding her
Here, with your Sister, at this time of night.

Lord Sir, what do you mean?

Truly there was a Necessity in it,
Which will, I hope, excuse my Intercession
With you in her behalf.

Now all comes out.

I understand you Sir, she does desire
To pass this night with Porcia, to assist her
In ordering her Nuptial Ceremonies:
Let her stay here a God's name.

If he does not dissemble, my Condition
Is not so desperate as I imagined.

I hope you'll pardon this great Liberty;
So early a Confidence will need it, Sir.

'Tis more than enough Sir, that you desire it,
Th'Occasion too does justify her stay.

'Tis most true Sir, the Occasion did enforce me
Thus boldly to presume upon your Friendship.

Have done for Heavens sake, is it a Novelty
Think you for Porcia, and her Cozin-Germin
To pass a Night together?

Is she so near a Kinswoman of his?
Strange Inadvertence in her not to tell me
Her relation to him, when I named him first.
I'd made fine work on it had I told him all.

She knows I owe her many a Good-turn
Upon Octavio's score,
To be able to repay her to the full.

Can he declare his mind in plainer terms?

I cannot tell which of us two he means,
But I begin to fear that he knows all.

Since 'tis so late, pray give the Ladies leave
To retire to their Chambers; Go in Sister.

My Brothers Words, and his Behaviour
Imply some Mystery; I must be silent
Till I discover more.

Let us begone, we're lost if we stay here;
I'm confident he counterfeits this Calm
To disguise his Revenge, until Antonio,
And the rest of the House are gone to Bed.

But we shall ne'er be able to get out
Whilst they continue in the outward Rooms.

Yes, by the Garden-dore, but I'm afraid 'Tis shut.

No; now I think on it, Flora went that way,
And left it open.

Come, lett's be gone; I hope Heaven does ordain
Ease by that Door which first let in my Pain.

I'll only make a step Sir, to my Lodging,
And then return to you immediately.

Pray give me leave to wait on you.

I humbly thank you Sir, I know the way,
And shall not stay above a Moment from you.

You're Master here, Sir.

I'll now go see whether my Servant Sancho
Has brought Octavio to my Apartment,
As I directed him.

Heavens! was there ever so strange a Mystery!
Don Carlos he affirmed that those we fought with
Had conveyed Porcia away, and when I come
To seek her in the House I find her missing,
To second this, her Waiting woman Flora
Tells me that she went down, about that time,
Into the Garden; Antonio, not long after,
Affirms that he both saw, and entertained her
In her own Apartment, where I now find her,
And Camilla with her: What can this be?
These sure are Riddles to pose an Oedipus;
But if by my own Sense I am assured
My Honor's safe, which was so much in doubt,
What matter is it how 'tis brought about.

DAme Flora, and Signior Diego, go in there.
And you my Friends, set down the Chair in th'door;
And when the Party's entered, pull it to;
'Twill lock of 't self; that done, you may be gone:
There's Money for you; I'll go fetch a Candle.

What!
And the door shut upon me! Diego, Flora.

Here am I Sir, and Flora too, unless
My Sense of feeling fails me.

I can't conjecture where we are; I durst not
So much as peep out of the Chair, since Flora
Gave me the warning; but where ever I am,
'Tis better far than in the Sergeants hands.

Though now in the dark, I know well where we are:
I have too often walked the Streets, Octavio,
From your House hither, upon Cupid's Errants,
Not to know the back door of Carlos's
Apartment; 'tis there I am sure w' are now.

Curse on thee, Flora! had thou lost thy wits
Not to let me know it sooner! think thou
I should have tamely suffered them to bring me,
Like a poor Bird shut in a Cage, to a place,
Where I must look for nothing but Destruction.

A Gypsy told me by my Palm long since,
A sour-fac'd Damsel should be my destruction.

Suspend a while your Apprehensions, Sir;
You may escape before the Candles come;
The door was wont to open on this side;
If not, I have another way in store.

Flora,

Nay then, i'faith, we're fast; I heard him give
The Key a double Turn.

Here's a fair Trial for your Maiden breath,
Flora blow 't in again, let's owe your Mouth
More Light, than yet your Eyes could ever impart.

Light's cast away on such an Owl as you;
But yet I'll try.

Thanks, gentle Flora, to your Virgin Puff;
'Tis a Strong breath that can o're-come a Snuff.
But I had rather 't had been let alone:
If I must needs be slain, unless it were
Behind my back, I'd have it in the dark;
For I hate to be killed in my own presence.

What must we do Flora? all my hope's in you.

There is yet room for Hope; there's Back-stairs
Beyond that inner Chamber, that goes down
Into the Garden, if the door be open,
As certainly it is, the way is easy.

Come, let's lose no time; prithee guide us Flora.

As well pleased as I am, to find my Honour
Less Desperate than I thought, I cannot rest
Till I have drawn from Porcia a Confession
Of the whole Truth, before she goes to bed;
She's in her Chamber now, unless by new
Enchantments carried thence.

I can't imagine what should make Don Henrique
Quit the Corrigidors till we returned:
One of his Servants tells me he's come home.
O here he is; now shall I raise a storm
Which (if we do not take a special care)
Will scarce be allaid without a shower of Blood;
Yet I must venture't, since it so imports
Our Friendship, and the Honour of our House.
Happiness is a stranger to Mankind,
And like to a Forced Motion, it is ever
Strongest at the beginning, then Languishing
With time, grows weary of our company;
But to Misfortunes we so subject are,
That like to Natural motion they prove still
More Vigorous in their Progress.

What means this Philosophical Preamble?

You I'know too soon I fear.

Don Carlos, I am now so well recovered
From all m'Inquietudes, that for the future
I dare defy the Malice of my Stars
To cause a new Relapse into Distemper.

Cozin, I'm so surprised with this great change,
That my Confusion does suppress my Joy;
But since you're so much Master of your Passions,
I'll spare my Ethics, and proceed to give you
In short the Narrative of our success;
The Corrigidor (as we did expect
Forward to serve you in th'Affair I mentioned)
Was pleased to go along with me in person,
With a strong Band of Sergeants, to the place,
Where I attended by your Servants led him:
Cozin, 'twas there; it wounds my heart to speak it;
And I conjure you summon all your Patience:
'Twas there I found --

Whom Cozin did you find? for since I'm sure
You found not Parcia there; my Concernments
In your Discoveries are very unlikely
To discompose me.

I would to Heaven we had not found her there.

What's that you say, Cozin, my Sister there!

Yes Sir, your Sister.

My Sister! that's good i'faith: ha, ha, ha.

Why do you laugh? is the Dishonour of
Your Family become a Laughing Matter?
This is a worse Extreme me-thinks than the other.

How can I choose but Laugh to see you Dream;
Awake for Heavens sake; and recall your Senses;
Porcia there said you?

Yes Sir, Porcia I say; your Sister Porcia;
And which is more, 'twas in Octavio's House.

Why sure you're not in earnest, Cozin.

As sure as you're alive I sound her there.

Then you transport me, Sir, beyond all patience:
Why Cozin, if she has been still at home,
Antonio seen, and entertained her here,
Accompani'd by Camilla; if even now
I left them there within; Is't possible
You should have found her in Octavio's House?
To be here, and there too, at the same time,
None sure but Janus with his double face
Can ever unfold this Mystery.

Sir, let me advise you; Abuse not your self:
I tell you positively I found her there:
And by the same Token, her Waiting-woman
Flora was there attending her.

Flora! dear Cozin, do not still persist
Thus to affirm impossibilities.

Sure you are making some Experiment
Upon my Temper, and would fain provoke
My Patience to some such high Disorder,
That I should ne'er hereafter have the face
When you are in you Fits to play the Stoic.

Cozin, I swear to you upon my Honour,
'Tis not above a quarter of an hour,
Since I did speak with Porcia, and your Sister
In that very Apartment, and am now
Returning to them in my Sister's Chamber.

And Sir, I swear to you upon my Honour,
'Tis not above a quarter of an hour,
Since I left Porcia carried in a Chair
From Don Octavio's House, your man Geraldo
Conducting the Chair-men to mine, and follow'd
By Flora, whilst I came to find you out
To acquaint you, Sir, with this unpleasing news:
But fit for you to know as soon might be.

This Question, Cozin, may be soon decided,
Pray come along, her Chamber's not far off.

And my House is but the next door, let's in.

You'll quickly find your Error.
Here comes your Servant, whom I left to Guard her;
He'll instantly convince you of the Truth.

O Sir!

What brings you hither Geraldo?

O Sir, I bring you such rare news, your Enemy,
Your Enemy Octavio -- I'm out of breath.

What does the Varlet mean?

Sir, I suppose Don Carlos has informed you
That he left me to see your Sister P'rcia,
With Flora, and Diego Octavio's Man
Safely conveyed t'his House.

See now Don Henrique, who was in the Right.

I did as he commanded me, and put them
All three into Don Carlos's Anti-chamber;
Porcia in the same Chair which brought her thither;
And for more safety made the door be locked;
Whilst I went down in haste to fetch a Light.

As sure as Death this Madness is Infectious;
My Man is now in one of Carlos Fits.

Returning with a Light a moment after,
No sooner opened I the door, but Heavens!
Who should I see there standing just before me
In the same place where I left Porcia, but
Octavio, your Enemy Octavio.

Here is some Witch-craft sure; what can this mean?

Amazed at the sight, I let the Candle fall;
And clapped the door to; then I double-lock'd it,
And brought away the Key.

But how could he get in, if you be sure
You locked the door, when you went out for Lights?

I know not whether he was there before,
Or got in after, but of this I'm sure,
That there I have him now, and safe enough.

I am sorry for it.

Let's not, Don Carlos, now perplex our selves
With needless Circumstances, when? and how?
Those Queries are too Phlegmatic for me;
If the Beast be in th'd Toil it is enough;
Let us go seize upon him; he must die.

Good Brother, what unhappy Man is he,
Whom you so positively doom to death?
I have a Sword to serve you in all occasions
Worthy of you, and me.

His intervening, Carlos, is unlucky,
How shall we govern our selves towards him
In this Affair? so unfit for his knowledge?

Antonio is a Man of shining Honour;
But having such a share in this Affront,
If once he know it, I am afraid he'll bring
Fuel, not Water to Don Henrique's Fire.
Don Henrique,
What answer to return, he's not a Man
To be put off with any slight Pretences;
Nor yet to be engaged in such an Action,
As bears th'appearance rather of Cruelty,
Than Honour, and you know, Antonio needs
No fresh Occasions to support his Name;
Who Dangers seek, are indigent of Fame.

I find my coming hath disordered them,
There's something they would fain conceal from me;
All here is discomposed, what er's the matter.

Perhaps 'twere better to suspend a while
The Execution of your just Revenge:
Time, and mature weighing of Circumstances,
Never did harm in Actions of this Nature;
Where one has still the Party in his Power.

A Curse on your Tame Proposition Carlos!

He, who the Rules of Temperance neglects,
From a Good Cause may produce Vile Effects.


In all the near Concernments of a Person
Alli'd to you as I am; but Noble Brother,
It were against the Laws of Hospitality,
And Civil Prudence to engage a Guest
(Newly arrived after so long a Journey)
In an occasion, Sir, of Blood, and Hazard.

If such be the occasion, I must then
Acquaint you freely, that I wear a Sword,
Which must not be excluded from your Service;
I'm sure you are too Noble t'imploy yours
In any Cause not justifi'd by Ho^r;
But I confess there are Affronts so great,
And heightened by such odious Circumstances,
As do release us from the usual Forms
Of Generous Revenge; and set us free
To tak't on any Advantage.

Though with Regret I see, Sir, I must yield
To your excess of Generosity;
This only I shall say to satisfy
Your just Reflections; that my Resentments
Are grounded on Affronts of such a Nature,
That as nothing but the Offender's Life
Can ever repair them, so as to the Forms
Of taking that Revenge, they can't admit
Of the least scruple.

Honor's my Standard; and 'tis true, that I
Had rather Fall, than Blush for Victory;
But you are such a Judge of Honor's Laws*
That 'twere Injurious to suspect your Cause.
Allow me, Sir, th'honor to lead the way.

If Porcia be there too, (as I believe)
'Twill prove, I fear, a fatal Tragedy;
But should she not be there; yet 'tis too much
For such a Heart as mine, through Ignorance
To have betrayed a Gentleman, though Faulty,
In to such Cruel hands; I must go with them;
But so resolved, as in this Bloody strife
I'll salve my Honour, or I'll lose my Life.

O the unluckiness! I vow t'you Sir,
I have scarce known that door ever locked before.

There's no Remedy Flora, I am now
At the Mercy of my Enemies.

Having broken into another Ground,
'Tis just i'faith* you should be put in the Pound.

The Tide of my ill Fate is swoln so high,
'Twill not admit increase of Misery;
Since amongst all the Curses there is none
So wounds the Spirit as Privation.
For 'tis not where we Lie, but whence we Fell,
The Loss of Heaven's the greatest Pain in Hell;
When I had sailed the doubtful Course of Love,
Had safely gained my Port, and far above
My Hopes, the precious Treasure had secured,
For which so many Storms I had endured;
To be so soon from this great Blessing torn,
That's hard to say, if 'twere first Dead, or ^orn,
May doubtless seem such a transcendent Curse,
That even the Fates themselves could do no worse;
Yet this I bore with an erected face,
Since Fortune, not my Fault caused my Disgrace;
But now my Eyes unto the Earth are bent,
Conscious of meriting this Punishment,
For trusting a fond Maid's Officious Care,
My Life, and Honor's taken in this Snare;
And thus I perish on this unseen Shelf,
Pursued by Fate, and False unto my self.
Flora,
These Tablets give to Porcia; there she'll find,
That to th'Extremest Moment of my Life
I constantly pursued those Noble Ways,
Which might Deserve her, though I could not Have her.
Give me the Candle.

A double Curse upon all Love in earnest,
All Constant Love; 'tis still accompani'd
With strange Disasters; or else ends in that
Which is the worst of all Disasters Marriage.

Sure you could wish that every body living
Had such a Soul of Quick-silver, as yours,
That can fix no where.

Why 'twould not be the worse for you, dear Flora,
You then might hope in time to have your Turn,
As well as those, who have much better Faces.

You, I presume Sir, would be one o'th'latest
Which I should hear of, yet 'tis possible
That one might see you, before you should be welcome.

She has Wit, and good Humour; excellent
Ingredients to pass away the time;
And I have kindness for her Person too,
But that will end with Marriage, and possibly
Her good Humour; for I have seldom known
The Husband, and the Wife make any Music,
Though when asunder they can play their parts;
Well, friend Diego, I advise you to Look
Before you Leap, for if you should be Coupled
To a Yoke instead of a Yoak-fellow,
'Tis likely you may wear it to your Grave.
Yet, honest Diego, now I think on it better,
Your Dancing, and your Vaulting days are done,
Faith all your Pleasures are three Stories high,
They are come up to your Mouth, for you are now
For Ease, and Eating, th'onely Joys of Life,
And there's no Cook, nor Drie-Nurse like a Wife.

I could find Reasons too for Matrimony,
A Stale Maid is a horrible reproach,
I must confess it; and a Waiting-woman
Does only change a Mistress for a Master;
I may quit her, 'tis true, but not my Husband,
And on the other side she may quit me,
And turn me off, when old, and good for nothing.
A Husband's bound to keep me still; In fine,
For ought I can perceive the Scales are Equal,
I may throw Cross and Pile, which Life I'd have,
The Single Beggar, or the Marri'd Slave;
But hark! the Door within, from whence we came
Is newly opened, or my Ears deceive me.

Methoughts I heard it too, let us peep in.
O Sir,
Coming most terribly upon us.

Away you troublesome Fool.

I'm confident no body saw us pass
From the other House.

However, let's go through my Brother's Quarter,
And open the Back-door into the Street;
'Tis good in all Events to have a Retreat
More ways, than one.

O Heavens!
Has clapped that door to thorough which we came.

The Accident's unlucky, 'tis a Spring-lock,
That opens only on the other side.

Let's on the faster, and make sure of the other. Octavio here!

Porcia in this place! may I trust my Senses,
Or does my Fancy create these Chimeras?

Either we Sleep, and Dream extravagantly;
Or else the Fairies govern in this House.

Ah! dearest Mistress, you shall never make me
Quit you so again.

But can that be Octavio?

I was Octavio; but I am at present
So much astonished, I am not my self.

What can the meaning of this Vision be?

My dearest Porcia, how is't possible
To find you in this place, noble Antonio
Having so generously undertaken
Your protection?

Did he not yours so too? and yet I find
Octavio here, where he is more exposed
Than I, to sure destruction; I am loath
To say 'tis he, who has Betrayed us both.

Antonio false? it is impossible.

It is too evident.

Peace Slave; he is my Friend, of Noble Blood,
Whose Fame's above the Level of those Tongues,
That Bark by Custom at the brightest Virtues,
As Dogs do at the Moon.

How hard it is for Virtue to suspect.
Ah Octavio! we have been both deceived;
This vile Antonio is the very Man,
To whom my Brother without my Consent,
Or Knowledge has Contracted me in Flanders.

Antonio the Man to whom you're Contracted,
Porcia the Bride whom he is come to Marry?

The very same.

Why did you not acquaint me with it sooner?

Alas, I have not seen you since I knew it;
But those Few hours such Wonders have produced,
As surpass all Belief, and do require
More time, than your unsafe Condition here
Will allow us to make you understand it.

Dear Friends, I cannot blame your Apprehensions,
Nor your Suspicion of Antonio's Friendship:
But I am so possessed with the Opinion
Of his great Virtue, that I shall as soon
Believe Impossibilities, as his
Apostasy from Honour.

What's her Concernment in Antonio, Porcia?

O, that's the strangest part of our sad Story;
And which requires most time to tell you.

See, Flora, at the Window, what's that Light,
And Noise we hear.

O Madam! we are all undone, I see
Henrique, Carlos, and their Servants with Torches
All coming hither, and which is wonderful,
Antonio leading them with his Sword drawn.

Thou dream, distracted Wench; Antonio false?
It is impossible.
All she has said is in appearance true,
There's sure some hidden Mystery which thus
Abuses us; for I shall ne'er believe
Antonio can transgress the Rules of Friendship.

Friendship's an Empty Name, made to Deceive
Those, whose Good Nature tempts them to believe;
There's no such thing on Earth, the best that we
Can hope for here is faint Neutrality.

Ye Powers above! what pleasure can ye take
To Persecute Submitting Innocence?

Retire, dear Porcia, to that inner Room,
For should thy cruel Brother find thee here,
He's so revolted from Humanity,
He'll mingle thine, with my Impurer Blood.

That were a kind of Contract; let him come;
We will meet at once Marriage, and Martyrdom.

Soul of my Life retire.

I will not leave you.

Thou preserv'st me by saving of thy self;
For they can murder only half of me,
Whilst that my better part survives in thee.

I will die too, Octavio, to maintain,
That different Causes form the same Effects;
'Tis Courage in you Men, Love in our Sex.

Help me Camilla.

You must be ruled, your Presence will increase
Your Brother's Fury, and Octavio's Danger.

That Argument is Irresistible.

Nay if you are at that,
The hindmost; 'tis for your sake, dearest Flora,
I shun these Honourable Occasions.
Having no Weapon,
March off with the Baggage.

I'm now upon the Frontiers of this Life,
There's but one step to Immortality;
And though my cruel fortune has allow'd me
No other Witness of my Tragic end,
But my Inhumane Murderers; yet my Death
Shall not Disgrace either my Life, or Love;
To the other World this Honour I will bear,
That as I still have Lived, and Loved, so I
Encounter Death with the same Constancy.

Where is the Man whose Insolence, and Folly
Has thus misled him to Affront my Friend?

Here is the Man thou seek, and he, whom thou
So basely hast Betrayed.

Oh Heavens! what is't I see? It is Octavio My Friend.

Not thy Friend, Antonia; but 'tis Octavio,
Who by thy Perfidy has been betrayed*
To this forlorn Condition; but vile Man,
Thou now shalt pay thy Treachery with thy Life.

Hold Octavio; though thy Injurious Error
May transport thee, it shall not me beyond
The Bounds of Honour; Heaven knows I thought
Of nothing less, than what I find, Octavio
In this place.

What pause is this, Antonio? all your Fervour
In the Concernments of your Friend, reduced
To a tame Parley with our Enemy?
Do all the Promises, you have made to me,
T'assist my just Revenge, conclude in this?

Do all the Promises you have made to me,
T'assist my Virtuous Love, conclude in this?

Where is your wonted Bravery? where your Kindness
To such a near Allie?

Where is your former Honour? where your Firmness
To such an ancient Friend?

What course shall my Distracted Honour steer
Betwixt these equal,

What, demur still? nay then I'll right my self.

Wh'attaques Octavio must pass through me.

I must lay hold on this Occasion.
Good Cozin, I conjure you to restrain
Your Passion for a while, there does lie hid
Some Mystery in this, which once unfolded,
May possibly produce the Means of making
That Reconcilable, which now seems Desperate.

Sweetly proposed, Sir, an Accommodation?
Think thou my Anger's like a Fire of Straw,
Only to Blaze, and then expire in Smoke?
Think thou I can forget my Name, and Nation,
And Barter for Revenge, when Honour Bleeds?
His Life must pay this Insolence, or mine.

Mine must protect his, or else perish with him.

Since neither Faith, nor Friendship can prevail,
'Tis time to try what proof you are, Antonio,
Against your own near Int^rst; Know, that Man,
Whom you protect against my just Revenge,
Has seconded his Insolence to me
By foul Attempts upon my Sister's Honour;
Your Porcia's Sir, if this will not inflame you.

This Injury's beyond all Sufferance.

To what excess of Folly does our Rage
Transport us Men!
Which Tortures could not have made him discover,
He (only to advance his blind Revenge)
Has now unforc'd declared to that Person,
From whom, of all men living, he ought most
To have concealed it.

How! I attempt your Sister's Honour Henrique?
The Parent of your black Designs, the Devil,
Did ne'er invent a more malicious Falsehood;
'Tis true, that I have served the Virtuous Porcia,
With such Devotion, and such Spotless Love,
That, though Unworthy, yet she has been pleased
To recompense my Passion with Esteem:
By which, she has so chained me to her Service,
That here I vow either to Live her Prize,
Or if I Die, to fall Loves Sacrifice.

O Heavens! what's that I hear? thou blessed Angel
Guardian of Honour, I do now implore
Thy powerful assistance to preserve
That Reputation, which I hitherto
By Virtuous Actions have maintained unblemished;
In vain, Don Henrique, you design to change
My Resolutions; it must ne'er be said,
That Passion made Antonio recede
From the strict Rules of Honour; Sir, I tell you,
Nothing can make me violate my first
Engagement.

Nay, then thou shalt Die too, Perfidious Man;
Ho! Geraldo, Pedro, Leonido.

For Heaven's sake, Cozin, draw not on your self
The horrid Infamy of Assasinating
Persons of Noble Blood by Servile Hands.

Do you Defend them too? Kill 'em I say.

Retire Octavio, I'll sustain their shock.

Octavio retire?

Trust me you must, they will surround us else;
Through that narrow Passage they'll Assail us
With less advantage.

What do ye give back, ye Men of mighty Fame?

Don Henrique, you shall quickly find 'tis Honour,
Not Fear makes me retire.

Now we shall have a breathing while at least
Octavio, and time to look about us;
Pray see yon other door be fast.

Geraldo,

Heaven has heard our Prayers; they are both safe here.

Let's go to 'em Camilla.

'Tis better to stay here a while, and hearken
What Resolution of themselves they take.

So, 'tis now as I could wish.

What do you mean, Generous Antonio?

To Kill thee now my Self, having performed
What Pre-engagement did exact from me
In your Defence against Others; my Love now
Requires its Dues, as Honour has had his;
There's no Protection for you from my Sword,
But in your Own, or in your frank renouncing
All Claim to Porcia; She is so much mine,
That none must Breath, and have the Vanity
Of a Pretender to her whilst I Live.

My Claims to Porcia I shall ne'er renounce,
But still assert them by all noble ways;
Yet, Sir, this hand shall never use a Sword
(Without the last Compulsion) against that Man,
Who has so much Obliged me; no Antonio,
You are securely Guarded by the Favours,
You have conferred upon me.

Sir, let not your pretended Gratitude
Enervate your Defence; 'tis not my custom
To serve my Friends with Prospects of Return;
I therefore, Sir, do freely here acquit you
From all the Obligations, you are pleased
To own from me.

You may, Sir, if you please, forbear to add
New Favours to my' account; but you can never
Substract those, which are past; and till that Debt
Be fully paid, I shall not dare to appear
In the Lists against so Generous a Creditor.

Your Scruples are ill grounded; 'twas Octavio
(My ancient Friend) whom I designed to Serve;
Not that Disloyal Man, who has invaded
My Honour, and my Love; 'Tis the Intent Creates the Obligation, not the Event.

I call those Powers, who both Discern, and Punish,
To witness for me, that I never knew.
You ever pretended to Don Henrique's Sister,
Before I came within these fatal Walls:
This I declare, only to clear my self
From th'Imputation of Disloyalty;
And to prevent the Progress of your Error.

How can I think you should speak Truth to me,
Who am a Witness y'have been False to her,
To whom, you now profess so high Devotion.

I false to Porcia! take heed, Antonio,
So foul an Injury provokes too much;
But, Sir, I must confess I owe you more,
Than the Forgiveness of one gross Mistake.

Rare Impudence! I must not trust my Senses.

If we cannot adjust this Competition,
Let us our Fortunes, not our Passions charge
With this our breach of Friendship.

Leave your Discourses, and Defend your self;
Either immediately Renounce all Claims
To Porcia;

Nay,

Why do I doubt? there is no means to save him
From the present danger, but by another,
Perhaps as great, but something more remote;
I'll do it.

What's this! Antonio fighting with Octavio!
This Bravery is excessive, Gallant Friend;
Not to allow a share in your Revenge
To him, who's most concerned; he must not die
Without some Marks of mine.

Nay, then my Honour you invade anew,
And by Assaulting him, Revive in me
My Pre-engagements of Protecting him
Against all others.

Why were not you Antonio fighting with him?
Were you not doing all you could to Kill him?

Henrique, 'tis true; but finding in my breast
An equal strife 'twixt Honour, and Revenge;
I do in just compliance with themboth
Preserve him from your Rage, to Fall by mine.

Brave Man, how Nicely he does Honour weigh!
Justice her self holds not the Scales more Even.

My Honour suffers more as yet than yours,
And I must have my share in the Revenge;
Either he must renounce all Claims to Porcia,
Or Die immediately.

It is agreed: that he must Do, or Die:
But by no other hand, than mine.

Cease your Contention, and turn all your Swords
Against this Breast; whilst Porcia' and I have breath,
She must be mine, there's no Divorce but Death.

I'll hear no more, protect him if thou can

Kill the Slave, kill him, I say.

For Heaven's sake hold a Moment; certainly
There's some Mistake lies hidden here, which cleared,
Might hinder these Extremes.

These Errors must be cleared, before they grow
Too fatal, but I fear your Brother's fury
Will not admit of Reason.

I'm sure I'll try, though it should cost my life.

Don Henrique.

Antonio, Carlos

Octavio.

Ha! how came she here?

Did not I tell you that she was brought hither
By my Directions? you would not believe me.

But how then could Octavio come hither?

Nay, that Heaven knows; you heard as well as I
Your Man's Relation.

Ah thou vile Woman! that I could destroy
Thy Memory with thy Life.

Hold,

What may not I do Justice upon her Neither?

No Sir; although I have not yet the Honour
To know who she x's, I have this night engaged
My self, both to Secure, and Serve her.

He knows not Porcia; who was in the right
Don Henrique, You, or I?

He not know Porcia? whom not an hour since
I saw, and spoke with, entertaining her
In his Apartment; sure we are Enchanted,
And all we see's Illusion.

Allow me, Henrique, to dispel these Charms;
Who is't, Octavio, you pretend to? speak.

You might have spared that Question; since none
Knows so well as you, 'Tis Porcia I adore.

Porcia's my Wife;

Hold Sir; which is the Porcia you claim too?

Can you be'n doubt of that? you know too well
The Conquest, that you made so long ago
Of my surprised heart in Flanders.

Conquest! Surprised! Flanders! what can this mean?

New Riddles every moment do arise,
And Mysteries are born of Mysteries.

Thanks be to Heaven, our work draws near an end;
Cozin, it belongs to you to finish it.

To free you from that Labyrinth, Antonio,
In which a slight Mistake, not Rectifi'd,
Has involved us all; know, th'suppos'd Porcia,
Whom you so long have loved, 's the true Camilla.

And you, Don Henrique, know, Octavio
Has always been your Sister's faithful Lover;
And only Feigned a Gallantry to me,
His real Passion to Disguise from you.

Octavio.

Brave Antonio, how happy are we both!
Both in our Loves, and Friendships!

Man's Joys do ne'er to their Perfection rise,
Till when by Crosses heightened, they surprise.


To whom you owe your Life, and Liberty;
And I much more, the safety of my Honour.

Is this the Gallant Leader, who rescued us
With so much Valour from th'Enemy's hands?

The very same.

If you knew him so well, why did not you
Acquaint me with it sooner? 'twas a fault Camilla.

Alas,
Conspiring with the Graces of his Person,
So soon possessed him of my Heart, that I
Despairing ever again to see him; and
Ashamed of such a Visionary Love,
Durst never trust my Tongue with my own Thoughts.

'Tis enough.
Take here from me the Hand of her,
Heaven, and your Merits have long since made yours
Without my Knowledge; may her Virtue pay
Some part of that, which we both owe to yours.

Here with your leave,
Of my Eternal Faith unto you both.

But let's take heed, Antonio, lest whilst we
Are Joying in our mutual Happiness,
Don Henrique's scarcely yet composed Distemper
Revive not, and Disorder us afresh:
I like not his Grim Posture; you know well
After a Tempest, though the Wind be laid,
There often does remain for a good while
A dangerous Agitation of the Waves;
He must not yet be trusted with himself.

'Tis well thought on, let us go to him.

Here with Respect we wait the Confirmation
Of Heaven's Decrees from your Indulgence,
This Lady* your Incomparable Sister,
Can witness that I never did invade
Your Passion for Camilla; and Pedro's death
Happened by your mistaken Jealousy;
The Causes of your Hate being now removed,
'Tis just, Don Henrique, the Effects should cease.

I shall consult my Honour.

You cannot take a better Counsellor
In this Case, than you Own, and Sister's Honour;
What, to secure them both, could have been wished
Beyond what Fate hath of it self produced?

How hard it is to Act upon Constraint.
That, which I could have Wished, I now would Fly;
Since 'tis obtruded by Necessity.

Noble Don Henrique, make account of me
To be as truly yours by this Alliance,
As if a Brother's Name subsisted still.

I must consent,
He is a Fool who thinks by Force, or Skill
To turn the Current of a Woman's Will
Since fair Camilla is Antonio's Lot,
I Porcia yield to Don Antonios Friend.
Our Strength, and Wisdom must submit to Fate.
Script of my Love, I will put off my Hate.
Here,
Happier, than she has done me.

Had such Disorders ever such a Come-off?
Me-thinks 'twould make a Rare Plot for a Play.

Faith Flora, I should have the worst of that;
For by the Law of Comedy 'twould be
My Lot to Marry you.

Well thought on, Diego, though spoken in Jest;
We cannot do, I think, a better thing
In Earnest, than to make them Two Join Hands.
What say thou to it, Flora?

Indeed I have had so many Frights this night,
That I am even afraid to lie alone.

Give me thy Hand Flora,
I promise thee, dear Spouse, I'll do my best
To make thee first Repent this Earnest Jest.

That time shall try.

Since this last happy Scene is in my House,
You'll make Collation with me are we part.

Agreed, agreed, agreed.

Agreed, agreed, agreed.

Sir, you had best make haste, else what you call
Collation, may prove a Breakfast, for 'tis
Near twelve a Clock.

Thus end the Rare Adventures of Five Hours;
As sometimes Boisterous Storm's in Gentle Shours.

Come Gentlemen!
Let the Dons, and Monsieurs say what they will;
(...) our parts, we are for Old England still.
(...) e's a fine Play indeed, to lay the Scene
(...) th^ee Houses of the same Town, O mean!
(...) we have several Plays, where I (...) fie.
(...) Devil to tell where the Scene does lie:
^imes in Greece, and then they make a step
^nsilvania thence at one Leap
To Greece again: this shows a ranging Brain,
Which scorns to be confined to a Town in Spain.
The possible Adventures of Five Hours;
A copious Design, why' in some of ours
Many of the Adventures are impossible,
Or if to be achieved, no Man can tell
Within what time; this shows a rare Invention,
When the Design's above your Comprehension:
Whilst here you're treated with a Romance Tale,
And a Plot covered with a Spanish Veil.
It is as easy as a Proclamation,
As if the Play were Penned for th'whole Nation.
None of those thundering Lines, which use to crack
Our Breaths, and set your Wits upon the Rack.
Who can admire this Piece, or think it good;
There's not one Line, but may be understood.
As innocent, as if it had past the Test
Of a full Synod: not one Bawdy Jest;
Nor any of those Words of Double Sense,
Which makes the Ladies, to show their Innocence;
Look so demure; whilst by a simp'ring Smile,
The Gallant shows he understands the Style.
But here you have a Piece so subtly Writ,
Men must have Wit themselves to find the Wit:
Faith that's too much; therefore by my consent,
We will Damn the Play.

Think thou,
That these, who know the Pangs of bringing forth
A Living Scene, should ever destroy this Birth.
You ne'er can want such Writers, who aspire
To please the Judges of that Upper ^ire.
The Knowing are his Peers, and for the rest
Of the Illiterate Crowd (though finely dressed)
The Author hopes, he never gave them cause
To think, he'd waste his Time for their Applause.
You then (most equal Judges) freely give
Your Votes, whether this Play should Die, or Live.
W'Have passed the Lords, and Commons; and (...)
At length, Dread Sir, to hear Your Final Doo^
'Tis true, Your Vassals (...) may Vo^e the Laws,
Their ^ Divine Applause.
This Shining Circle then will all sit Mute,
Till one pronounce from you* Le Roy le Ven^.
