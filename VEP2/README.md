# New Files for VEP2

1. `tls-eebo-2021-plus.csv`

    This GitHub Repo: https://github.com/lb42/eebo-bib has 
    good metadata (including TCP connections) for EEBO.

    Instead, I took the processed version (I did not run the scripts)
    and converted it from XML to CSV for metadata builder.
    The script for converting it is in https://github.com/uwgraphics/VEP2-Scripts

    I got the file from https://app.box.com/s/3p6ft7xebsrp6rd6jv0lzde19tx28en5 

    I am using `tls-eebo-2021-plus.xml`.
